Crawling and Deduplication of Polar Datasets Using Nutch and Tika

Politeness Configurations:
To deal with politeness, properties were added to the file nutch-site.xml. We labeled our
nutch bot (http.agent.name) as CS572 RASNA, the agent description
(http.agent.description) was set to a string saying that we are crawling as a part of an
assignment and our email-idâ€™s were mentioned under agent email (http.agent.email). The
value for number of requests per second (fetcher.thread.per.host) was kept as default.
