Cookies must be enabled. UCAR PRIVACY POLICY This privacy policy covers UCAR's treatment of personal information. Please review the UCAR General Privacy Policy so that you can understand your options in using the UCAR Web site. Use of this Web site signifies your agreement to the General Privacy Policy. Within this Site you may access other UCAR-sponsored sites and services. Some of these sites and services are governed by their own privacy policies. In the absence of a referenced Privacy Policy, this General Privacy Policy shall apply. What Personal Information Does UCAR Collect? You can visit most UCAR Web sites and access most of our services without identifying who you are, or revealing personal information such as your name, birth date, e-mail address or mailing address, that can be used to identify you. However, some services may require registration. When you register with us, you may need to complete certain fields (some are required and some are optional), as well as choose a user name and password. In these situations, if you choose to withhold any personal information requested by us, it may not be possible for you to gain access to certain services or parts of a specific Web site. If you do provide personal information when signing up for a service or completing a survey, UCAR will process such information for specific and limited purposes which we inform you about when we ask you for information. For example, we may collect and use personal data to provide you with services, to respond to a question, or to communicate with you for other purposes. Except as described in Section 3 hereof, unless expressly described in an applicable privacy policy, UCAR will not distribute your information to third parties. General Use Information UCAR receives and stores certain types of information whenever you interact with the Web site. For example, UCAR maintains Web activity log files such as the number of pages requested, time spent on a page, and result sets from search queries. UCAR extracts and aggregates information from these log files to gauge and improve the effectiveness of the Web site and services. UCAR does not link this general use information to other personally identifiable information. Sharing of Information From time to time, UCAR may share information with its sponsors, outside contractors, auditors, consultants, and others hired by UCAR to assist in carrying out financial or operational activities. UCAR informs these parties about safeguarding personal information, and requires them to use it only for an authorized purpose consistent with this privacy policy. Cookies Parts of the UCAR Web site may use cookies to improve your interaction with the site or service (e.g. directing your browser to the same server in a cluster for your entire session). UCAR Web sites may also use cookies for Web traffic analysis purposes (e.g. determining unique visits to a site). Signing Up For Services In some instances, UCAR may request information through an enrollment process for a Web service, Web site analysis, survey, or event registration. To enroll or participate, you may voluntarily supply personal information. UCAR shall use the information, and may share the information with event planners, as described in the enrollment process or Section 3 of this Policy. Contact the Web site operator to correct any information you submit. Security UCAR maintains all personal data with technical, administrative, and physical safeguards intended to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, and improper use. No computer system or information can be completely protected against every possible hazard, but UCAR provides reasonable and appropriate controls to protect personal information against foreseeable hazards. Public Forums UCAR maintains a number of public e-mail lists and forums for use by interested individuals. Some are open for subscription and use; others are moderated where a list or forum moderator may limit subscription and posting access. In each case, users can subscribe and unsubscribe from these areas at any time. Contact the Web site operator to correct any information you submit. Please note that any information that you post to a public bulletin board or chat room is available to all persons accessing that site. Unsubscribing from a list or forum will not remove any name, e-mail address or information that was part of any previous posting from any archive of these lists or forums. Legal Requirements UCAR may disclose information in response to legal process, such as a court order or subpoena. Children's Guidelines Students are advised to consult with their parents before giving any personal information online. Third Party Sites This Privacy Policy applies only to UCAR Web sites that do not have their own express privacy policies. UCAR may provide links to other Web sites which we believe may be of interest to our visitors. Due to the nature of the World Wide Web, UCAR cannot and does not guarantee the standards of Web site links it provides and cannot be held responsible for the contents of non-UCAR sites. By entering such sites through the links provided, you accept all responsibility for use and agree that you will not hold UCAR responsible for anything that happens as a result of your entering and using such sites.

Hittson 2010 Cryoconite Evolution and Formation on an Arctic Glacier Surface: A Case Study and Model Dataset Abstract: Cryoconite holes are vertical cylindrical holes that form on glacier surfaces due to the lower albedo of sediments. Cryoconite holes exist on Linnebreen, Svalbard over the entirety of the glacier. They preferentially melt below the surrounding glacier surface and eventually create standing water above them. In this study, six cryoconite holes were created by placing sediments on the glacier surface and observing their growth and movement for a period of fourteen days. They ranged... Jaurrieta 2005 Understanding Inflow Stream Discharge and Sediment Flux Variability, Linnédalen, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: Climate change due to global warming in high latitude regions is causing ice caps and glaciers to melt. The melt, in turn, influences fluvial systems and may cause higher levels of stream discharge and sedimentation rates. In an attempt to map out significant climatic events of the modern Holocene period in the Svalbard Archipelago, Linnédalen (Linné Valley) was chosen as the field site to conduct arctic research. The goal is to study this area for the next three years and piece...

Nelson 2010 A Varved Sediment Analysis of 1,000 Years of Climate Change: Linnévatnet, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: In July 2009, we recovered a varved sediment core from 35 m in the deep main basin of Linnévatnet, a high Arctic glacial lake in Svalbard. Arctic lakes are key locations for studying climate records because the Arctic is highly sensitive to climate change and because varves reflect seasonal and annual sedimentation rates. Previous research in Linnévatnet has focused primarily on the proximal basin near the Linnéelva (Linné River) inlet where it is difficult to distinguish annual... Nereson 2010 Sedimentation Rates in the Distal Basin of Arctic Proglacial Linnévatnet, Western Spitsbergen, Svalbard: Evidence from Radioactive Fallout Cesium-137 Dataset Abstract: The rhythmically laminated sediments found in proglacial Linnévatnet in western Spitsbergen, Svalbard may be suitable for the reconstruction of paleoenvironmental conditions such as temperature, precipitation, and glacier mass balance. In order to use these sediments as a proxy for past environmental change, however, we must understand which modern environmental factors contribute to Linnévatnet’s patterned sediments. The goal of this study is to further that... Nussbaum 2013 A Temporal Analysis of Suspended Sediment Concentration Changes in A Proglacial Meltwater Stream, Linnébreen, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: Data suggest that climate change has significantly affected and will continue to affect global environments. Furthermore, research suggests that the current warming trend will continue, and it is therefore important to study current environmental systems in order to understand the complicated dynamics of warming and response (Parry, Canziani, Palutikof, van der Linden, & Hanson, 2007). Arctic environments are particularly sensitive to climate change, and are therefore a critical area... Otter Lake (Alaska) Sediment Data for Lake-Level Reconstructions (NSF Award #0909362) Dataset For this collaborative research project, Lehigh University was responsible to derive a lake record from south-central Alaska to reconstruct environmental change and to understand nonlinearities of climate change during the Holocene.

Yellen 2006 Summer Time Suspended Sediment Transport in Lake Linné, Svalbard Dataset Conclusions: Several forces affect summer time suspended sediment transport within Lake Linné. Most notably, surface winds and associated Ekman transport drive currents easterly or westerly on a daily basis. Melting of the delta icing over the course of the summer allows a progressively larger channel to flow out of the eastern side of the inlet delta. Depth distribution of sediment plumes is predictably influenced by density contrasts between the inlet water and the lake water. During... Zamora 2010 Using Sediment Geochemistry, Particle Size Distribution and Remote Sensing to Study Provenance in the Kronebreen/Kongsvegen Glaciers, West Spitsbergen, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: Sediment provenance at the Kronerbreen/Kongsvegen glaciers in Spitsbergen can be used to understand the effects that climate change can have on the sedimentation in fjords, and streams at northern latitudes. These sediments are directly related to glacial processes and reflect the conditions under which they formed. Such conditions are sensitive to global climate change, which is amplified in northern latitudes, creating a unique environment for climate change research. ... Zamora 2011 The Role of Underflows and Weather on Sediment Distribution in Glacial-Fed Lake Linné, Svalbard, Norway Dataset Abstract: Linnévatnet (78° 2’N, 13° 49’E), is a glacial-fed lake located in Svalbard, an archipelago north of Norway. Sediments found in the lake are supplied by the Linné Glacier, 8km south of the lake, and are transported by the melt stream into the lake, creating laminations with a strong signal of seasonal deposition.

Dataset Collaborative Research: Nonlinearities in the Arctic climate system during the Holocene   Collaborative Research: Nonlinearities in the Arctic climate system during the Holocene (Award #0909354) Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: Raymond Bradley Author(s): Raymond Bradley (rbradley@geo.umass.edu) Description: Rapid changes in the Arctic climate system that occurred in the relatively recent past can be compared with the output of climate models to improve the understanding of the processes responsible for nonlinear system change. In particular, this study focuses on the transition between the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) and the onset of Neoglaciation, and on the step-like changes that occurred subsequently during the late Holocene. The millennial-scale cooling trend that followed the HTM coincides with the decrease in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation driven by slow changes in Earth's orbit. Despite the nearly linear forcing, the transition from the HTM to the Little Ice Age (1500-1900 AD) was neither gradual nor uniform. To understand how feedbacks and perturbations result in rapid changes, a geographically distributed network of proxy climate records was examined to study the spatial and temporal patterns of change, and to quantify the magnitude of change during these transitions. During the HTM, summer sea-ice cover over the Arctic Ocean was likely the smallest of the present interglacial period; certainly it was less extensive than at any time in the past 100 years, and therefore affords an opportunity to investigate a period of warmth similar to what is projected during the coming century. This study focuses on lakes because lakes are the most widely distributed sources of proxy climate records that consistently extend through the post-glacial interval. Because climate change is amplified in the Arctic, the climate signal preserved in Arctic lake sediments should be stronger than elsewhere. Confidence in the paleoclimate reconstructions was bolstered by a multi-proxy approach, and by replicate lake records to distinguish basin-scale thresholds from regional-scale climate shifts. The results we provide are part of a collaborative project (with ~10 other PIs) who all used lacustrine sediments to produce new high-resolution proxy climate records of the past 8000 years. The study sites we focused on were in southeastern Greenland, where four lakes were studied. Sediment cores were recovered, dated and analyzed for organic and inorganic content. Each data set was then interpreted in terms of past environmental changes that the sediments recorded. This project contributes to an understanding of climatic variability, a key challenge facing society. Specifically, it provides insights into the feedback processes that cause the climate system in the Arctic to change faster than any other region on Earth. The spatial network of paleoclimate reconstructions serves as key benchmarks for validating climate models and for improving their ability to accurately simulate nonlinear change, including changes in sea-ice cover.

This study involves analysis of a core from Kongressvatnet, a small lake in Kongress Valley on the high-arctic archipelago of Svalbard. Multiple characteristics of the core are examined in order to reconstruct the glacial history of the valley. There are three major questions that this study seeks to address: 1) whether during the Little Ice Age, a cold period between about the 14th and 19th centuries, the glacier that once inhabited Kongress Valley grew large enough to have contributed melt-water and sediment to Kongressvatnet, 2) what the timing and extent of the Little Ice Age in Kongressdalen was, and how this characterization compares to other locations on Svalbard and around the Northern Hemisphere, and 3) whether or not the core examined in this study records late 20th century warming. Analyses of samples from the core and of samples from fans feeding Kongressvatnet include: stratigraphic description, X-ray Diffraction, Loss on Ignition, Cesium 137 and Lead 210 dating, and bulk density. These analyses provide for three main proxies of past glacial extent: 1) X-ray Diffraction provides a carbonate index for samples, which indicates sediment provenance and therefore provides a record of activity of the glacially-fed fan, 2) LOI provides a measure of the weight percent organic matter of samples, which is used as an indicator of clastic sedimentation rate and, indirectly, glacial extent, and 3) dating provides a measure of changes in sedimentation rate, as well as chronological control for that part of the core sampled for dating. The results of this study suggest that the glacier in Kongressdalen grew large enough during the Little Ice Age to have contributed melt-water and sediment to Kongressvatnet. There is also evidence in the core of warming in the past 40-50 years from increased organic content. Instrumental measurements of the water temperature of Kongressvatnet support this finding. The results of this study provide for an overall characterization of the Little Ice Age in Kongressdalen. There are two major culminations of Little Ice Age glaciation evident in the core. The first began around or before 1320 A.D., with maximum ice extent occurring around 1330-1340 A.D. The first culmination of glaciation lasted until approximately 1400-1430 A.D. A period of conditions too warm or dry for glacial advance pervaded from approximately 1430 A.D. until about 1690-1710 A.D. The maximum ice extent during the second culmination of the LIA occurred around 1770-1800 A.D. A secondary maximum probably occurred near the end of the second culmination of the LIA; retreat from this second maximum was happening around 1929 A.D. The end of the LIA in Kongressvatnet is defined in this study as the time when retreat from the final glacial maximum was occurring, in 1929 A.D. This characterization fits fairly well with other studies conducted on Svalbard, and provides for comparison to other locations in the Northern Hemisphere.

This geomorphic analysis is in collaboration with a short core analysis of sediments from the lake. The interpretation and comparison of the lacustrine sediment record and the surficial geology record of Kongressvatnet will draw conclusions about past climate variation in western Spitsbergen during the Holocene. The surficial geology map and structural geology map of the Kongressvatnet catchment was complied from field observations (July and August 2006) and detailed aerial photographic interpretation. This study used lichenometry, pebble counts, GPS and altimeter elevations and topographic profiles to collect morphologic and temporal data. Units were classified based on the morphology, grain size, sorting, rounding, sedimentary structures, lithological content, vegetation cover, and the slope of each deposit. Temporal variance was determined by lichen long axis length (using Rhyzocarpum geographica, based on Werner, 1990), vegetation cover (relative difference), presence of periglacial features and relative surface elevation (specifically for fluvial surfaces). Well defined shoreline terraces are found at 5m above modern lake level (104-105m a.s.l.), at 10m above modern lake level (109-110m a.s.l.), and indicate that lake levels were at least 10m higher in the past. If the modern outlet was not incised (threshold at ~110m) and the large inactive colluvial fan in the channel like wind gap (NW of Kongressvatnet) was not present (threshold at ~110m) it is possible that Kongressvatnet drained into Linnedalen. A raised marine delta at 65m a.s.l. (11,000 yrs BP (referenced in Mangerud and Svendsen, 1990)) and large alluvial fan is present along the proposed wind gap outlet route. It is possible that these features were formed when (and if) a Kongressvatnet outlet flowed into Linnedalen. To the north of Kongressbreen, distinct trim lines, moraine-like mounds, weathering differences, and beheaded drainages indicate that ice extended beyond LIA limit in the form of a valley glacier. These features may be expressions of a Younger Dryas glacial advance or Late Weichselian deglaciation. Progress: Completed - Dataset fully collected/analyzed.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Arnold 2009 Sedimentation in High-Arctic Lake, Linnévatnet, Svalbard: A Modern Process Study Using Sediment Traps Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Linnévatnet is a High Arctic glacier-fed lake in Svalbard in which past climatic characteristics are recorded in laminated lake sediments that likely span the past 9,000 years. The laminae are comprised of annual terrigenous couplets consisting of distinct coarse summer and fine winter layers. Previous studies in similar proglacial lakes throughout the Arctic and alpine regions have determined that varves of this type may record an archive of past weather and climatic influences in the catchment area. Sedimentation in Linnévatnet has been studied since 2003 using sediment traps and instruments deployed yearly and seasonally. The traps were deployed at five locations in the lake proximal and distal to the major inlet. Depending on the water depth at each location two to five traps were attached mooring lines. In the sediment traps, the summer melt season sediment is represented by distinct coarse sediment events reflecting meltwater pulses, the timing of which are constrained by time lapse photography and loggers on the moorings. The first and coarsest (26 microns) grained sediment pulse was deposited on July 4  5,2008, coinciding with peak snowmelt discharge. Subsequent events appear as finer (12  14 microns) graded laminae in the traps and are associated with similar high discharge events in mid-July. The fine winter layer (5  8 microns) coarsens slightly upward and reflects quiet winter sedimentation. Sediment stratigraphy and grain size trends in 2007 2008 were compiled with sediment trap analyses back to 2003 to form a composite record to compare with lake bottom deposition as reflected in sediment cores recovered adjacent to the moorings. Thin sections of laminated sediments from the cores display complex summer layer stratigraphy with multiple sedimentation units as seen in the sediment traps. Correlation between distinct units in the thin sections and sediment traps was attempted to evaluate climatic and environmental conditions responsible deposition of recent varved sediments.

This study is designed to assess how these glaciers are now responding to these changes. We collected marine sediment samples near Kronebreen/Kongsvegan, a polythermal subpolar tidewater glacier in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, over the summer melt season of 2009. CTD/OBS and meteorological data were also collected to characterize this dynamic Arctic system. One-to-three-day modern sediment records were collected near the top, the middle, and the bottom of the fjord water column with mooring locations ranging in depth from 20 to 120 m below sea level. Accumulation rates from the bottommost sediment traps of 380, 220, and 160 kg/m2/yr were found at 0.45, 0.75, and 1.00 km, respectively, from the ice-marginal delta on the southern edge of Kronebreen/Kongsvegan. Sedimentation rates appear to decrease logarithmically away from the ice-marginal delta. Couplets of coarse and fine sediment were found in sediment traps from the meltwater sediment plume indicating a diurnal meltwater discharge pattern. The couplets may be due more to solar incidence than to temperature and precipitation. Tidal current velocity may play a role in differentiating coarse and fine particles as they are released from the meltwater sediment plume, but there is not sufficient evidence to test for this fully.

This period included a threshold discharge event in which suspended sediment concentration increased dramatically, resulting in 25% of total monitored sediment transport occurring in less than 3% (15 hours) of the total monitored time period. This appears to have been a sediment flushing event, with the system displaying sediment exhaustion following the peak in discharge and suspended sediment concentration. Denudation rates are estimated based on the calculated 1.41 million kilograms of suspended sediment transported by Linnéelva during the monitored time period. Based on this study, denudation in the upper part of the Linné valley is between 90mm/1000 yr and 350mm/1000yr. Progress: Completed - Dataset fully collected/analyzed.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Ceperley 2012 Using Clay Mineralogy to Analyze Sediment Sources, Kronebreen and Kongsvegen Glaciers, Svalbard, Norway Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Svalbard is a Norwegian island archipelago located at 79°N whose glaciers are highly susceptible to climate fluctuations. Glaciers located in Svalbard sit between warm water from the south and cold polar water from the north. This position increases their sensitivity to climate fluctuations. Due to amplified and continuous climatic warming at high latitudes, the glaciers of Svalbard are prime subjects for understanding not only glacial dynamics, but also the effects of contemporary climate change. Tidewater glaciers are dynamic systems, with ice retreating and glacial and subglacial streams continuously shifting. An understanding the current spatial distribution of sediment sources will aid in interpreting sediment core data. From this we can infer former climactic and environmental conditions. Kongsfjorden is a 15 km long fjord located in northwest Svalbard, with the glaciers of Kronebreen and Kongsvegen forming the head of the fjord. There are two main sediment sources that discharge sediment rich water into the fjord: a subglacial stream that forms an upwelling plume at the calving margin, and a glacial stream that forms a prograding delta complex from the southern margin of Kongsvegen glacier. This project aims to characterize these sediment sources based on the clay mineralogy found in the samples and to map their spatial distribution in the fjord. Sediment from the sediment sources was collected using water samples and vacuum filtering the water in order to catch the sediment. Sediment from the fjord floor was collected using an Eckman box-corer attached to a wire and winch system. Twenty-nine samples were collected, dried, and sieved to separate the silt and clay fraction from the coarser sediment. Using X-ray diffraction, the clay mineralogy of the samples was found to be composed primarily of illite and chlorite. The 001 diffraction peak of chlorite is not visible in several samples. Chlorite is commonly found in metamorphic rocks, which are present as a bedrock source underneath Kronebreen glacier, but not Kongsvegen. The absence of the 001 chlorite peak could be due to sample preparation or a weaker concentration of chlorite in those samples. Overall, the sediment in front of the calving margin of the Kronebreen and Kongsvegen glacier complex is well mixed and the sediment distributed by the upwelling plume and Kongsvegen Delta are not differentiable in the box cores samples Progress: Completed - Dataset fully collected/analyzed.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Cobin 2008 Evaluation of Modern Sedimentation Processes in a Proglacial Lake: Linnévatnet, Spitsbergen, Svalbard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Cores from proglacial lake, Lake Linné, on Svalbard contain varves that hold important information about past climate change. By establishing a relationship between modern sedimentation and measured environmental conditions, we hope to calibrate the late Holocene sediment record found in Lake Linné. Since 2003 sediment trap moorings at five locations in the lake have provided proximal to distal records of overall lake sedimentation. Each mooring also had multiple traps positioned at various water depths, providing insights into the sediment distribution processes in the basin. Trap data show a clear proximal to distal decrease in sediment accumulation and grain size. The data also show an increase in sediment accumulation and grain size as water depth increases. In the most proximal traps, the finest sediment is found at the traps bottom in a very thin layer. It is followed by an abrupt increase in particle size, which grades to the coarsest sediment found in each trap. During May of 2007, prior to the spring melt, sediment traps were deployed, and an automated camera was set-up to take pictures of the inflow into the lake. The spring traps do not record any of the fine sediment found in the bottom of the yearly traps, suggesting that the majority of sediment in the yearlong traps was deposited during/after the spring melt. In addition to the spring traps and camera, snow sensors and meteorological data associate the abrupt increase in particle size with the loss of the snow pack during the spring melt. After the loss of the snowpack, other pulses of coarse sediment are linked to rainfall events in the valley. In contrast, the sediment collected at the top of the traps in July and August, the height of the ablation season, has a finer texture (fine silt and clay). These findings are consistent with data from previous years, suggesting that for systems like Lake Linné, silt laminations are related to high stream discharge events, resulting from the loss of snow pack and large rain events. The annual clay layer thickness is related to the amount of annual glacier ablation, indicating that the thickness of the clay laminations in the lake cores may be the best proxy for reconstructing late Holocene glacier mass balance. The thickness and the texture of the corresponding silt laminations are related to the environmental conditions, sediment that is remobilized in the fluvial system during high discharge events.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Cumpstson 2006 Ice-Marginal Delta Formation and Sedimentary Processes Of Kongsvegen Glacier in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, Norway Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Over the last ca. 15 years, the southeastern portion of Kongsvegen glacier has retreated back onto land and an ice-marginal delta has formed at its terminus. The delta has an annual growth rate of 6.0x105 m3 a-1, determined from bathymetric profiling and aerial photos taken inbound and outbound of Ny Ålesund. Sedimentation in Kongsfjorden, where the subglacial derived meltwater stream discharges after flowing over the delta, were recorded, from sediment traps located at the given distances, as 7.5 ± 1.6 g cm-2 a-1 (69.4 mm a-1 vertical thickness) at 204m in fjord from the source, and 9.19 ± 4.4 g cm-2 a-1 (85.5 mm a-1) at 1193 m from the delta source. The higher value with distal location being attributed to the influx of sediment from a submarine, subglacial meltwater discharge plume from Kronebreen glacier ~2.5 km north of the newly formed delta (Trusel et al., 2006). Sedimentary processes, observed in CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) profiles, strongly resemble those characteristics of Alaskan glaciers in the temperate environment, including settling sediment layers, interflows, and turbidity flows. These structures are also recorded in both gravity and box cores by sedimentary core logging, magnetic susceptibility, core x-rays, and mineralogical and sediment size distribution histogram differences. Erosive efficiency and transportation of sediment of Svalbard’s polythermal glaciers, in the subpolar environment, are intermediately between Alaskan warm-based, temperate environment, and Antarctic cold-based, polar environment, glaciers. The sedimentation rate of glaciers in Svalbard is one order of magnitude above Antarctic glaciers, and one order of magnitude below Alaskan tidewater glaciers.

Studies of lacustrine sediment deposition and watershed dynamics allow for interpretation or calibration of the annual sediment yields and the connection to climatic controls. Sediment trap studies undertaken on Linnévatnet, a High Arctic glacial-fed lake on the largest island of the Svalbard archipelago, since 2003 provide a critical link from modern processes to the laminated sediment record. In the summer of 2010 a total of 31 traps were collected that were deployed in the summer of 2009. Their locations in relation to the inlet of the glacial stream Linnéelva range from proximal (.4km away) to distal (3.3km). Instrumentation in the Linné Valley, including time lapse cameras, temperature loggers, snow trees, and weather station data help facilitate understanding of climatic controls on glacial melt and stream discharge. Two sedimentation events occurred in the summer/fall of 2009, accounting for 25% of total sediment accumulation. Spring 2010 sedimentation began on 6/15 with an event that accounted for 12.5% of total yearly sediment accumulation. This was followed by the most significant event of the year from 6/24-6/30. This event accounted for 50% of the total sediment accumulation and was driven by the nival melt. Two further events were recorded by the intervalometer, each accounting for 6.3% of total accumulation. The first event was the result of settling of fine grained particles and the second was a distinct event driven by solar radiation and temperature. The nival melt is determined to be the dominant hydrologic event in the Linné valley and responsible for the majority of sedimentation in Linnévatnet. The timing and intensity of this melt event is controlled primarily by melting degree days. Further study is needed to determine the validity of using Linnévatnet’s varved sediment for paleoclimate reconstructions. Progress: Completed - Dataset fully collected/analyzed.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Gercke 2006 Relationships among Weather, Glacial Ablation, and Fluvial Processes, Svalbard, Norway Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: The influence of weather factors on glacier ablation is a topic of much debate in arctic scientific literature. Corresponding studies of glacier meltwater and stream suspended sediment characteristics are also common, but results vary with study location. This study aims to characterize the Linné valley in terms of seasonal glacial and fluvial patterns, and examine the effect of these parameters on sedimentation in Lake Linné. This study will contribute to the understanding of Linné valley processes and further the ultimate goal of interpreting Holocene climatic changes from lake sediment cores. During the 2005 field season (July 23rd-August 14th ), weather, stream and glacier ablation data were collected by the Svalbard REU team. Statistical analyses and physical observations were employed to characterize the relationships between these three physical realms and compare them to expected results as well as previously studied areas. Throughout the field season, the Linné Glacier melted 0.5 meters on average, causing diurnal fluctuations in stream stage and suspended sediment load. Relationships between suspended sediment and stream stage are explained by significant autocorrelation results but causal relationships between weather and stream parameters are more complicated due to the effects of lag time. Efforts to pinpoint direct sources of glacier ablation were less fruitful, partially because of inadequate data collection techniques. However, analysis of aerial photos documents over 1.3 km of retreat since the end of the Little Ice Age, with a dramatic increase in retreat rate after 1969. Comparison of physical results to similar studies suggests that the Linné valley conforms to expectations of high arctic cold-based glacier systems.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Helfrich 2007 Glacial Ablation Dynamics and Sediment Flux at Linnébreen, Spitsbergen Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Modern process studies conducted on Arctic glaciers provide valuable insight into dynamic responses observed in the high latitudes due to global scale climate change, with telltale implications for environmental change in the lower latitudes. This research was conducted on Spitsbergen, the largest island of Svalbard, as part of an NSF funded Research Experience for Undergraduates program. The Norwegian High Arctic, containing Svalbard, is influenced by the northern extent of the Gulf Stream and the advection of warm air and moisture to the high latitudes. Its position creates highly variable conditions which directly affect the mass balance of glaciers on Svalbard. Work by Hagen et al. (2003) calculated the surface mass balance of Svalbard to be -4.5+/-1 km3 Yr/1. Understanding the factors influencing glacier mass balance and quantifying ablation rates provides ground-truthed data to gauge the Arctic’s reaction to changing climatic conditions and its influence in the global climate system. A compilation of mass balance measurements, local meteorological data, stream gauge, and suspended sediment concentrations were studied over a five week period during the summer 2006 melt season. High resolution data was collected in 30-minute intervals and manual readings were taken at eight glacier ablation centerline stakes on Linnèbreen. Comparisons were made directly to meteorological data, affording assessment of the correlations between the local and regional weather data and the dynamic behavior of this glacier. Summer precipitation was found to be the main agent of surface lowering on Linnèbreen. Days of high precipitation correlate directly with days of greater surface lowering and peak suspended sediment in the meltwater stream. High rates of lowering are interpreted to be the result of latent heat release caused by meltwater and precipitation percolating down into and refreezing below the glaciers surface. This triggered the removal of overlying ice, providing a glassy surface until such time that eolian debris and new sediment could accumulate and melt in differentially due to contrasts in albedo. Sediment flux to the meltwater stream is derived by erosion of sediment liberated by prior glacial activity. Supply is dominated by active layer thawing around the meltwater stream, resultant of rising temperatures and precipitation induced high discharge. The rise and fall of discharge, allowing temporary storage in ice-marginal channels and braidplains, display a diurnal SSC trend. Linnèelva operates in a dominantly supply limited mode due to the lack of active glacial erosion, with signs of complete sediment depletion over the meltseason. Sedimentation rates are likely to rise as the active layer deepens around the proglacial meltwater stream due to rising temperatures, and proposed increases in the Arctic’s precipitation budget allow for high discharge events. A net mass balance of -1.14m water equivalent was measured for Linnèbreen in 2006, producing a volumetric melt of 0.0028km3. 93.6% of Linnèbreen’s mass now lies entirely below the modern ELA at 458m. Extensive mass loss, associated with the ice margin retreat of ca. 1200m from its maximum extent during the LIA, could signal a significant change in thermal regime from its previous inferred warm based structure. The vast supraglacial and ice marginal meltwater network strongly supports the instrumental data and conclusion that Linnèbreen is composed almost entirely of cold based ice. The 4-6°C warming at the end of this century proposed by Alley et al (2006), based on the literature and IPCC (2007), is expected to have vast consequences on Svalbard. These temperatures are over two times higher then values estimated for the warmer early Holocene by Hald et al. 2004 and Overpeck et al. 1997. The average ELA on the archipelago was calculated at ca. 450m by Hagen et al. (2003) coinciding with the altitude containing the most ice mass. Further warming, changes in moisture advection, and a freshening of the Arctic Ocean are expected to cause a rise in the regional ELA. This will result in accelerated deglaciation of Svalbard, a situation unprecedented during the Holocene. Progress: Completed - Dataset fully collected/analyzed.

Cryoconite holes exist on Linnebreen, Svalbard over the entirety of the glacier. They preferentially melt below the surrounding glacier surface and eventually create standing water above them. In this study, six cryoconite holes were created by placing sediments on the glacier surface and observing their growth and movement for a period of fourteen days. They ranged from 2.0 cm wide with a depth of 0.5 cm to 7.0 cm wide and a depth of 2.0 cm. The greater the size of the cryoconite, the more it enhanced the melting of the surrounding surface both where it was initially placed and when it traveled down glacier. The largest cryoconite hole finished the two-week period 1 m down glacier from its initial placement and melted nearly 10 times the area of glacier ice as its own initial area. I hypothesize that this is due to the hydrologic cycle at work on the glacier. In order to look at this, we modeled how the cryoconite holes would form using the lower albedo of the cryoconite and the sun's revolution about the field site.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Jaurrieta 2005 Understanding Inflow Stream Discharge and Sediment Flux Variability, Linnédalen, Svalbard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Climate change due to global warming in high latitude regions is causing ice caps and glaciers to melt. The melt, in turn, influences fluvial systems and may cause higher levels of stream discharge and sedimentation rates. In an attempt to map out significant climatic events of the modern Holocene period in the Svalbard Archipelago, Linnédalen (Linné Valley) was chosen as the field site to conduct arctic research. The goal is to study this area for the next three years and piece together a climate that can be directly lined to sediment deposition in Linnévatnet (Lake Linné). The purpose of this study is to understand what effect climate has had on the Kapp Linné landscape consisting of Linnébreen (Linne glacier), the glacier-fed braided stream, and the lake pouring out into the ocean during the modern Holocene. The focus of my research is the fluvial system at Linnéelva (Linné River). I examined the correlation between short term weather conditions, proglacial stream discharge, and sediment flux variability. I related stream discharge and stage by developing a rating curve. My results yielded an R2 value of 0.979, which is a high correlation. Stream discharge and sediment flux were influenced by temperature, which fluctuated with wind direction. Solar radiation varied inversely with temperature and did not correlate with stream discharge or sediment flux. These results will be used to interpret sedimentation rate variations in Linnévatnet (Lake Linné) and will help enhance future data collection techniques.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Lane 2005 Reconstruction of a Temperature Time Series for Linnédalen, Svalbard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: A temperature time series has been reconstructed for the period from 1974 to 2004 at Linnédalen, Svalbard (78°N latitude, Norway). A method for extending the time series back to the early 20th Century is also presented. This reconstruction is important as a surrogate instrumental record in a region of low observation density and high observation value. As an important site of paleoclimate research, Linnédalen’s meteorological record is essential to calibrating a multi-century record of regional climate change. Lake Linné, a glacial lake situated in the valley of Linnédalen, provides researchers with a high-resolution sediment record of climate change during the late Holocene. To better interpret this record, limited local meteorological data from the Valley have been coupled with longer regional weather records to develop an extended meteorological record for the location. The reconstruction and methods used are presented and assessed and recommendations for further work are provided. This project is part of the Svalbard Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program sponsored by the National Science Foundation. Progress: Completed - Dataset fully collected/analyzed.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Leon 2007 Comparison of Lamination Stratigraphies in Cores Recovered from Different Locations in Linnévatnet, Svalbard, Norway Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Due to the sensitivity of high latitude regions to global climate change, it is important to understand the role and response of the arctic environment to past climatic events. Lacustrine sediments can provide a useful archive of past environmental change preserved in structural, textural, and compositional variation. Linnévatnet, a large proglacial lake on Svalbard in the Norwegian High Arctic, contains a long record of annually laminated (varved) sediments. This study provides a high resolution sedimentation chronology from the lamination stratigraphy since 1963. Sediment cores were retrieved during fieldwork conducted in 2006 from sites along two transects. Using digital imagesof continuous thin sections, annual sediment couplets and intra-annual deposition laminae were identified. Laminae were visually correlated from proximal to distal coring sites and down to the depth of a 1963 137-Cs age (~20cm). The data indicate a complex sedimentary environment across the basin affecting varve formation. Preliminary comparisons to temperature and precipitation records from Longyearbyen suggest a relationship between laminae thickness and precipitation. The sediment record in Linnévatnet may potentially contains a high resolution proxy for changing climatic and glacial conditions of Svalbard during the late Holocene.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Magnabosco 2011 A Characterization of the Biology and Nutrient Cycling of Two Glacial Lakes in Isfjord Radio, Svalbard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Due to the fact that lakes in the high arctic are only exposed for two to three months out of the year, very little is known about the microbiology and nutrient cycling that occur in this region. Of greatest interest in these high arctic regions are the primary producers that control the majority of the biogeochemical cycling and carbon dioxide sequestration of the region. Therefore, it is important to understand how industrialization of the 20th and 21st centuries is affecting these delicate and vital ecosystems. This study explores two glacial lakes in the high arctic regionof Svalbard. In order to gain insight on the nitrate and phosphate supply ratios driving primary production in the region, a series of nutrient enrichment experiments (mesocosms) on eleven locations throughout Isfjord Radio, Svalbard were performed. Theresults of these experiments reveal that the primary producers of this region are highly responsive to the increased nitrogen deposition from the burning of fossil fuels in North America and Europe. In particular, this study shows that, the past decade alone, diatom diversity within these two lakes has significantly decreased in response to the increased nitrogen loading of these freshwater systems.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Marshburn 2010 Glaciomarine Oceanographic and Suspended Sediment Dynamics, Kongsbreen system, Svalbard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Quantifying estuarine circulation and the resulting sediment dynamics of tidewater glaciers is crucial to developing an understanding of these dynamic systems, and their response to climate and sea level change. This study characterizes oceanographic conditions and suspended sediment loads resulting from glacial meltwater in proximal distance to the glacier terminus of the Kronebreen-Kongsvegen system, Kongsfjorden, Svalbard as a component of the Svalbard REU project. The study was conducted during July and early August of 2009, coinciding with maximum melt water volumes induced by elevated summer temperatures, and approaching the spring tidal maximum. Major fjord, oceanic, and glacial- induced brackish meltwater plumes were identified and evaluated for suspended particulate load through CTD scans, optical back scatter (OBS) readings, and water samples taken in perpendicular transects roughly 200-1000 m from the glacial termini. Sub-glacial upwelling systems on opposing sides of the glacial face were targeted for analysis and comparison. The control of tidal fluxes¬¬¬ on sediment and interflow mixing was examined. The fjord is an example of a system with active marine glaciers transitioning to terrestrial systems, vulnerable to circulation changes. The estuary consists of a three layer stratified system. A turbid shallow estuarine brackish mixing layer was identified, with temperatures ranging between 3-4oCelsius and practical salinity ranging from 15 to 31, a result of glacial outwash. An intermediate Atlantic interflow was identified through a warm saline water tongue at depths of 15-20 meters, with mean temperatures between 4-5o Celsius and salinity of 31 to 32. The fjord bottom water was characterized by a drastic temperature decrease at 30 meters from 5 to 1.2o Celsius over a 10-20 meter interval, with salinity constant at 33-34. Suspended particulate loads from water samples and OBS values were higher in the unrestricted sub-glacial upwelling plume system as opposed to the system in the semi-enclosed delta. The surface mixed layer contained the highest suspended particulate matter, with a mean sediment concentration of 0 .1351 kg/m3, compared to the intermediate and bottom water values of 0.06801 and 0.04376 kg/m3, respectively. Data during ebb tide phases indicate reduced water column stratification. Fjord waters and currents are strongly driven by thermohaline convection cycles due to their partial enclosure and protection from open ocean winds and waves. Research characterizing density driven mixing properties of inner fjord basin water columns is limited. Data generated in this study can be used to investigate the effects of glacial outwash, comprised of freshwater and sediment, on fjord circulation. Understanding how glacial meltwater is exported from fjords and interacts with ocean-climate systems is critical to hypothesizing future climate behavior.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   McGregor 2012 Gravity Core Geochemistry at the Kronebreen Glacier, Svalbard, Norway: Quantifying Climate Flux in a Glacimarine Setting Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: During the present period of significant climate flux, scientists are attempting to understand and constrain the way in which Earth responds to these changes, as well as what these changes mean for life on the planet. The polar regions (the Arctic and Antarctic) are particularly sensitive to climatic perturbations, and they house extensive evidence of the impact that warming has had in the past, from changing ocean chemistries to the relationship between glacial retreat and fluctuations in sea level. As part of an NSF-supported Research Experience for Undergraduates, a group of students traveled to Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, Norway in the summer of 2011 to conduct individual research projects relating to sedimentology and climate studies. Svalbard is an archipelago in the North Atlantic Ocean with a variety of terrains that makes it conducive to studying different aspects of the Holocene geologic record. Sediments throughout the archipelago capture Holocene and modern proxies for past climate fluctuation. This summer’s project was based in Kongsfjorden, a northwest-trending fjord with two actively retreating tidewater glaciers (Kronebreen and Kongsvegen) at its head. Rapid sedimentation rates in Kongsfjorden during glacial retreat have resulted in a high-resolution record of the past few decades. This individual research project (as part of an ongoing senior thesis) seeks to analyze sediment-core geochemistry from the sediments on the floor of Kongsfjorden in a chronostratigraphic framework, using a variety of analytical techniques. This poster presents a multidisciplinary application of X-ray fluorescence, total organic content, Cs-137 and Pb-210 radioisotopic dating, and other methods of sediment core analysis to infer paleoclimatic states.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   McKay 2005 Characterization of Climatic Influences on Modern Sedimentation in an Arctic Lake, Svalbard, Norway Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Modern sedimentation in Lake Linné was studied as part of the NSF-funded Svalbard REU Project to calibrate the lamination stratigraphy in the glacier-fed lake. Lake Linné, located on the west coast of Spitsbergen, receives melt water from the Linné glacier, located 8 km up valley. The focus of the investigation is to better understand climatic effects on yearly sedimentation, and to better characterize annual variation in the sediment record. Sediment traps were deployed at five sites (each site having traps at varying depths), from July 2003 to August 2004, in order to facilitate spatial and temporal understanding of sedimentation occurring in the lake. The collected sediment was sub-sampled and analyzed using a Coulter LS230 Particle Analyzer in order to characterize textural changes both temporally in each trap, as well as spatially throughout the lake. Sedimentation rates calculated from the recovered yearlong sediment traps ranged from 277 to 28 mg/cm2/yr (1.5 to 0.15 mm/yr) from the most proximal to distal sites respectively. These sedimentation rates compare well to calculated average rates of sedimentation based on thickness of lacustrine sediment in the lake. Changes in grain size recorded in the sediment traps throughout the year demonstrate a strong peak in grain size associated with a spring melt event. These melt-out deposits are substantially coarser (median grain size = 53 µm) than any other sediment deposited during the year, including deposits associated with a high precipitation and discharge event (median grain size < 16 µm). This suggests that the spring melt sediment is deposited by different mechanism, most likely overland flow during the spring melt. Weather events (rain and solar insolation) affected the grain size of sediment deposited proximally in the lake; median grain size is strongly correlated to discharge from the inlet stream in the late summer.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Mitchell 2009 Mechanisms of Glacial Ablation at Linnébreen, Svalbard, Norwegian Arctic Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Modern glacial process studies on Arctic glaciers provide valuable information on responses to climate change in high latitudes, and may also suggest eventual implications for lower latitudes. Most Arctic glaciers exist at higher air temperatures than Antarctic glaciers, and are thus likely to show a more rapid response to global climate change. Understanding factors that influence glacier mass balance and quantifying ablation dynamics provide useful data to document the Arctic’s response to changing climatic conditions. Research was conducted on Spitsbergen, the largest island of the Svalbard Archipelago in the Norwegian Arctic, and was supported by the National Science Foundation Research for Undergraduates program at Hampshire College. Glacier surface lowering, meltwater discharge, and meteorological conditions were monitored during the 2008 summer melt season at Linnébreen, an Arctic cirque glacier. Nine glacier surface lowering measurements were taken at eight centerline locations over the course of the 2008 ablation season (mid-July through mid-August). These measurements were correlated to meteorological observations to better understand surface lowering dynamics of the glacier. Snow loss from Linnébreen was converted to a meltwater equivalent to estimate the volume of water lost from the glacier for each day. This volume was then compared to measured discharge in the adjacent meltwater stream. The highest ablation occurred during late July 2008, corresponding to periods of higher temperature and solar radiation. These 2008 results are consistent with historical records. Photo analysis reveals an average glacier retreat rate of 17 m/yr since 1936 with a rate of 41 m/yr during the past 14 years. Measurements indicate average surface lowering of 1.13 meters for the 2008 melt season, and a negative net balance of 0.34 meters, less negative than most years. Melting due to high temperature and direct sunlight are inferred to be the main agents of surface lowering of Linnébreen. Continued observation is essential to better evaluate the controls on surface lowering and negative mass balance of Linnébreen. The glacial mass loss at Linnébreen is consistent with other proxy climate records in the High Arctic, which indicate accelerated warming in this region.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Mortazavi 2009 Chronology and Correlations of High Arctic Lakes Based on Magnetic Properties Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Located at 78ºN, the island of Spitsbergen is covered by small glacal lakes. Linnévatent and Kongressvanet are two such lakes and are separated by about five kilometers along the western coast. These lakes have been part of an ongoing study to better understand the present and past climate changes. Chronology for cores recovered from these lakes is especially hard to establish, due to large amounts of detrial coal as well as the depletion of 14 C due to carbonate dissolution make 14 C-dating methods unreliable. During the summer of 2008 three cores were recovered from Linnévatnet with lengths of 32cm, 35cm and 65cm, near mooring sites D (core L08D), F (core L08F) and G (core L08G) respectively. In addition, one core (K08) from Kongressvatnet had a length of 67cm was collected. These were analyzed for paleomagnetic data finding that the K08 core gave a corrupted record, most likely due to the presence of gregite as shown by the environmental records. The Linnevatnet cores gave reliable records, with the longer record (L08G) having a sudden drop in declination at 33cm. This drop was the basis of the two age models. Age Model I based on the record given and dates the core to be 3500 years old. Age Model II involves a rotation of the declination data an dates the core to be ~350 years old. Based on grain size changes indicated by the environmental magnetic data as well as varve analysis of a similar core Age Model II is determined to be more valid, dating L08G to ~350 years BP. In addition L08D and L08F did not show enough variation to be compared to longer timescale, thus were only dated using Age Model II; giving ages of ~140 years BP for both cores.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Nelson 2010 A Varved Sediment Analysis of 1,000 Years of Climate Change: Linnévatnet, Svalbard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: In July 2009, we recovered a varved sediment core from 35 m in the deep main basin of Linnévatnet, a high Arctic glacial lake in Svalbard. Arctic lakes are key locations for studying climate records because the Arctic is highly sensitive to climate change and because varves reflect seasonal and annual sedimentation rates. Previous research in Linnévatnet has focused primarily on the proximal basin near the Linnéelva (Linné River) inlet where it is difficult to distinguish annual sediment layers from event-based layers. The lake core analysis will therefore contribute to our understanding of the sediment stratigraphy in the deep main basin where varves reflect annual sedimentation. Core IC09.1 is 39.8 cm long and contains 1154 ± 71 couplets, which we measured in Photoshop using high-resolution (4800 dpi) scanned images of thin sections. The varves range in thickness from 0.06 mm to 2.60 mm with a mean thickness of 0.34 mm. To make a proxy climate record, we compared varve thickness to summer temperature, summer precipitation, winter precipitation, and glacier mass balance from the instrumental record. Summer temperature and summer precipitation show a statistically significant positive correlation with varve thickness, though with a low coefficient of determination (r2). We used thickness and a regression equation to estimate climate pre-dating the instrumental record. If higher summer temperatures and increased precipitation are related to thicker varves, then summer temperature and precipitation have been greater in the 20th Century than in the past 1,000 years, and climate change in the 20th Century has been greater than during the Little Ice Age and the Medieval Warm Period.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Nereson 2010 Sedimentation Rates in the Distal Basin of Arctic Proglacial Linnévatnet, Western Spitsbergen, Svalbard: Evidence from Radioactive Fallout Cesium-137 Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: The rhythmically laminated sediments found in proglacial Linnévatnet in western Spitsbergen, Svalbard may be suitable for the reconstruction of paleoenvironmental conditions such as temperature, precipitation, and glacier mass balance. In order to use these sediments as a proxy for past environmental change, however, we must understand which modern environmental factors contribute to Linnévatnet’s patterned sediments. The goal of this study is to further that understanding by estimating the rate of sedimentation in Linnévatnet’s distal basin over a period for which climatic conditions are well constrained (1963-2009). Average estimates for the sedimentation rate were calculated using concentrations of fallout 137-Cs in two sediment cores (GC09-1 and GC09-2). Results from both coresindicate average sedimentation rates of 0.49 and 0.64 mm/yr, respectively, over the last half-century. The estimated sedimentation rates presented here are similar, but typically lower, than those put forth by previous workers who used varve counts, paleomagnetic methods, and sediment traps to quantify sedimentation rates over the same period. The evidence from this study for low sedimentation rates in Linnévatnet’s distal basin (<1mm/yr) implies that some recent years are poorly recorded by the archetypical annual silt-clay couplet, or varve. In the future, annual sedimentation patterns may be more accurately resolved by comparing varve counts to 137-Cs profiles that have been measured on the same core or series of cores.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Nussbaum 2013 A Temporal Analysis of Suspended Sediment Concentration Changes in A Proglacial Meltwater Stream, Linnébreen, Svalbard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Data suggest that climate change has significantly affected and will continue to affect global environments. Furthermore, research suggests that the current warming trend will continue, and it is therefore important to study current environmental systems in order to understand the complicated dynamics of warming and response (Parry, Canziani, Palutikof, van der Linden, & Hanson, 2007). Arctic environments are particularly sensitive to climate change, and are therefore a critical area to study (Svendsen & Mangerud, 1997). The purpose of this paper is to investigate water discharge and suspended sediment flux patterns in a proglacial meltwater stream flowing from the Linnébreen glacier in Spitsbergen, Svalbard, and to characterize sediment storage in the proglacial system. Changes in suspended sediment concentration (SSC) act as sensitive indicators of interactions between the glacier, climate, and landscape (Strzelecki, 2009). This work uses statistical methods to provide a framework with which to qualitatively describe subseasonal forcings behind discharge and SSC changes in the proglacial meltwater stream. Precipitation is found to be a primary forcer of both discharge and suspended sediment concentration changes. Furthermore, a subseasonal split was determined midway through the monitoring period, described by lessening lag times between discharge peaks and SSC peaks, and indicating a continued maturation of the entire system. Continued research of this nature will contribute to the ongoing effort to characterize the dynamics of the Linnébreen basin and to continuing research on Arctic glacier responses to the effects of climate change.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Pendleton 2011 The Glaciofluvial Environment of Linnébreen, Spitsbergen, Svalbard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Suspended sediment concentrations (SSC), meltwater discharge and local climatic conditions of the Linné glaciofluvial system were monitored from July 21 to August 9, 2010 in order to determine the temporal relationships between local climate, glacier melting and sediment production. ISCO water samplers were installed along the main meltwater channel to record SSC. SSC was directly related to discharge of the glaciofluvial system, which was in turn dependent on melt of the Linné glacier. The relationship between SSC and climatic conditions can be linked to the rate of glacier melt, which is in turn controlled by local climatic conditions. Of all the observed weather conditions, precipitation had the highest impact on glacier melt and discharge and therefore had the highest correlation to SSC. During periods without precipitation, solar radiation was the greatest influence on glacier melt and SSC. Measured SSC and calculated sediment load for the season from the Lower (distal) site was substantially less than the measured SSC and calculated sediment load at the Upper (proximal) site. The differences between the two sampling sites indicate that the glaciofluvial system immediately downvalley of the glacier is acting as a sediment sink. This study has established that increased SSC is largely due to increased precipitation. The presence of a pro-glacial sediment sink interrupts the sediment signal produced by the glacier and complicates the sediment record down valley in Lake Linné.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Perrault 2006 Mineralogical Analysis of Primary and Secondary Source Sediments to Linnévatnet, Spitsbergen, Svalbard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Linnévatnet, Spitsbergen, Svalbard is a high Arctic lake containing a sediment record that extends through most of the Holocene. Laminated lake sediments such as those found in Linnévatnet can serve as high resolution proxies for long term climate change. This study utilizes detailed mineralogical analysis to identify changes in the source of sediments to Linnévatnet during the late Holocene. These climatically sensitive sediment sources include a major proglacial river; alluvial fans, solifluction lobes and the meltwater stream from a small cirque are secondary sources. Distinct bedrock lithologies (phyllite, sandstone, carbonate and dolerite) in the valley strike north-south parallel to the lake, making provenance work possible. Pebble counts, conducted in the field at each sediment source, reveal a strong correlation between cobble and boulder lithology and underlying bedrock source. Laboratory identification of the gravel fraction of surficial sediment samples indicates increased break down of phyllite and carbonate in comparison to the sandstone. Grain size analysis of source sediments implicates differences in the mechanism of sediment transport and deposition at different sources. Unique mineral compositions were identified for each sediment source studied using paired x-ray diffractometer (XRD) and quantitative analysis of the sand, silt and clay sized fractions. West shore solifluction sources are recognized by the abundance and presence of sheet silicates (muscovite, chlorite, kaolinite) in all size fractions. The cirque outwash stream is distinguished by higher amounts of chlorite in all size fractions and the abundance of albite in the silt fraction. East shore sources are characterized by higher amounts of carbonate minerals and the presence of accessory minerals (rutile, pyroxene). Linnéelva sediments contain relatively less carbonate, albite and chlorite/kaolinite than the west and east shore sources. Continuous grain size analysis of four surface cores from different locations in the lake show variations in grain size through time, indicating changes in sediment transport. Paired XRD and quantitative analysis of the silt and clay fractions from core subsamples indicate changes in mineralogical composition down core at all locations but are limited in scope. Higher amounts of silt, paired with an increase in chlorite/kaolinite and a distinct stratigraphy, indicate increased glacier activity in the core proximal to the cirque. Higher amounts of sand, decoupled from silt trends and paired with the presence of local mineralogy (orthopyroxene, calcite) in the two deep basin cores indicate increased east slope activity. Differences in grain size distribution of the two deep basin cores implicate solifluction lobes as a contributor to sedimentation in the north end of the deep basin.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Pompeani 2009 A 360 year Varve-Based Climate Reconstruction from Linnévatnet on Western Svalbard Metadata Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Linnévatnet (78.05° N; 13.8° E; 12 m asl) is a proglacial lake located on the western coast of Spitsbergen, the largest island of the Svalbard archipelago. The 5.75 km² lake is set in a 35.3 km² catchment and fed by the glacier, Linnébreen, (1.7 km²) along with several small cirque glaciers. Currently, Linnébreen covers roughly 5% of the watershed in the valley of Linnédalen. The vast majority of sediment is moved into the lake during the early summer snow melt; however, particularly warm summers increase sediment transport from the landscape into the lake as the glacier continues to generate melt-water (Werner et al., 2008; McKay, 2005). Previous sedimentological studies (Pratt, 2006; Leon, 2006; Yellen, 2006; Snyder et al., 2000) have focused on sediment cores recovered from basins proximal to the inflow delta of Linnéelva in 10 to 15 meters water depth. These studies have shown that the sediments are annually laminated (varved) in these locations. Here we present results of varve thickness measurements from two sediment cores from mooring G (B1-08, B2-08) taken in the deepest basin (35 m water depth), located in the distal northerly portion of the lake. High resolution thin section analyses down both cores find that varve thickness trends are in agreement. Increasing annual varve thickness measurements show a positive correlation (r² = 0.32, 0.18 P < 0.01) with yearly historic summer (July-August) temperature measurements from a meteorological station at Isfjord Radio Station (1947-2003 AD). External forcings (solar, volcanic, etc) appear to play a key role in environmental change, especially prior (< 1850 AD) to increased anthropogenic aerosols and CO2. Despite the relatively short length, Linnévatnet’s varve record adds to the few high-resolution climate data in a region critical for understand earth’s climate system.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Poppick 2010 Modern Depositional Processes Proximal to a Polythermal Tidewater Glacier Complex, Kronebreen -Kongsvegen, Kongsfjorden: Svalbard, Norway Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: A series of sediment gravity- and box-cores was collected in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard during the summer of 2009 as part of the Svalbard Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) project, which aims to characterize the modern sedimentary environment proximal to the Kronebreen-Kongsvegen tidewater glacier margin. This study serves to generate baseline data for future assessment of the local polythermal glacial response to climate change, and to contribute to the framework by which proximal polythermal glaciomarine environments are interpreted in the sediment record. Sedimentary facies identified within the cores, collected between 300 – 900m from the ice face and spanning the ice margin, serve as proxies of modern meltwater and depositional processes at the tidewater margin. Sedimentary facies are characterized, with increasing resolution, through x-radiograph, thin section, and grain size analyses and are considered in relation to local fjord floor morphology and sediment trap data. The lithofacies established in this study account for the dominant depositional mechanisms in the fjord, including turbidity currents, suspension settling, and iceberg rafting. These lithofacies relate well with those found in temperate fjords, suggesting that these two glacial regimes may be indistinguishable in the rock record. Ubiquitous evidence of sediment reworking from turbidity currents in all cores suggests a predominance of underconsolidated mud along the slope of the submarine outwash fan and surrounding moraines. Cyclically laminated fine sand/silt and clay couplets, interpreted to have settled from suspension, are also preserved at varying intervals throughout some cores. Preliminary comparison with sediment trap data suggests that such cyclicty may correspond with the semidiurnal tidal cycle, such that the vertical accumulation of two couplets represents daily sediment accumulation rates. Daily sedimentation rates have hence been preliminarily estimated to be 2 mm/d in a region 600m from the northern ice front, but more elaborate sediment trap data is needed to better constrain this estimate. Ultimately, this study provides an archive of the depositional environment proximal to Kronebreen Kongsvegen for the benefit of future studies addressing the effects of climate change on this subpolar glaciomarine environment.

The purpose of this work is to calibrate the top 25 cm of cores to records of environmental change during the past 50 years to serve as a calibration in order to understand environmental change during the late Holocene. Sediment cores recovered from glacier-fed Lake Linné contain varved millimeter-scale silt/clay laminations offering annual records of past conditions. Four short cores (<0.5 m long) and four long cores (approximately 2.3 m long) were recovered from three different locations in Lake Linné in August 2004 and May 2005. Cores contain millimeter to centimeter-scale laminations, which are best studied in thin section. Color and grain size changes define silt and clay couplets between 0.5 and 11 mm in thickness. Distinctive laminations can be correlated between cores from locations 0.5 km apart indicating lamintation stratigraphy represents basin-wide depositional events.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Rajagopalan 2012 Characterizing Fjord Oceanography near Tidewater Glaciers Kronebreen and Kongsvegen, in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: In recent years, warmer Atlantic-origin waters have intruded into Svalbard's westcoast fjords. To predict the effect of the TAW (transformed Atlantic water) intrusion on the ice margin of tidewater glaciers, a detailed understanding of fjord circulation is important. While the general fjord circulation of Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, is well understood, water masses closest to the ice margin {and directly responsible for submarine glacial melt {are more difficult to study. To characterize the water masses and interpret fjord circulation at the calving-fronts of glaciers Kronebreen and Kongsvegen, Svalbard, oceanographic fieldwork was conducted along five primary transects, with the view to account for tidal influences as well. CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) devices with attached OBS (relative turbidity) sensors were used to collect data that range from 200 m to 1.7 km from the ice face, between 22 Jul and 6 Aug 2011. Current velocities were also estimated using drogues constructed while in Svalbard. The data show significantly variability in the water column stratification between just days. In addition to the tidal cycle, winds and other factors also appear to play a major role in glacial discharge streams and circulation. A comparison with data collected in the same region in Jul 2005 (by Trusel et al. 2010) show the 2011 Intermediate Water (IW) at depth to be warmer than the 0 local water (LC) that was observed at comparable depths in 2005. These two layers lie above the TAW and may be warmer as a result of convection with increased TAW waters. Increased intrusion of Atlantic-origin waters after 2005 are likely to have warmed the waters in the inner fjord of Kongsfjorden, indicating that the ice margin of tidewater glaciers in Kongsfjorden are susceptible to heat fluxes from North Atlantic water intrusions.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Roop 2007 Sedimentation in a Proglacial Lake: Interpreting Intra- and Inter-Annual Sedimentation in Linnévatnet, Spitsbergen, Norway Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: As part of the larger National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates on Svalbard (NSF-REU) project, this study focuses on lake sediment distribution processes and sediment flux during the 2005-2006 melt year. Using an array of vertically and spatially distributed sediment traps, the collected sediments have been related to local meteorological conditions and melt-water inputs. Five mooring sites were established both proximal and distal to the primary inflow, Linnéelva, containing 2 to 4 funnel-type sediment traps, distributed between 2m below the surface to 1m above the lake bottom. The collection period for this study was August 2005 to August 2006. Additionally, two summer traps were deployed at Mooring C (the most proximal site) during the observational period (July-mid August, 2006), to characterize “summer” sedimentation in the basin. Grain size analyses shows a basin-wide three-unit stratigraphy including a fine basal layer interpreted as “winter”, a coarse “spring layer”,and an upper unit of intermediate grain sizes interpreted as summer. The three units suggest annual silt/clay couplet (varve) sedimentation, supporting the 137-Cs core chronology. This “varve” stratigraphy was consistent throughout the lake and further supports two previous sedimentation studies in Linnévatnet (McKay, 2005; Motley, 2006). Sediment flux during the study period showed that sediment flux did not increase with depth while the two previous studies showed a consistent increase of sediment flux with depth. This suggests that different depositional processes occurred during these two years. Inflow, surface and bottom water temperatures were compared to identify times of under, inter and overflow conditions. These results suggest that in addition to precipitation and temperature, changes in sediment distribution processes can directly influence the thickness and texture of varves, further complicating the interpretation of past climate and environmental change. Given these internal lake dynamics and their impact on sedimentation, the results suggest that the location from which lake cores are taken may likewise be important with regard to interpreting the varve record of glacial-fed lakes.

Currently, mechanics that control the duration and ice flux from a surge remain poorly understood. Here, we examine submarine glacial landforms in bathymetric data from Engelskbukta, a bay sculpted by the advance and retreat of Comfortlessbreen, a surge-type glacier in Svalbard, a high Arctic archipelago where surge-type glaciers are especially prevalent. These landforms and their spatial and temporal relationships, and mass balance from the end of the last glacial maximum, known as the Late Weichselian in Northern Europe, to the present. Beyond the landforms representing modern proglacial sedimentation and active iceberg scouring, distinct assemblages of transverse and parallel crosscutting moraines denote past glacier termini and flow direction. By comparing their positions with dated deposits on land, these assemblages help establish the chronology of Comfortlessbreen’s surging and retreat. Additional deformations on the seafloor showcase subterranean Engelskbukta as the site of active thermogenic gas seeps. We discuss the limitations of local sedimentation and data resolution on the use of bathymetric datasets to interpret the past behavior of surging tidewater glaciers.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Schiff 2005 Unsustainable Glacier Ablation at 78° N latitude, Linnébreen, Svalbard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Understanding the amount and timing of stream inflow to Linnevatnet is of critical importance when attempting to quantify sedimentation. Linnebreen, located 6km south of Linnevatnet, is the largest source for inflow to Linnevatnet. Mass balance measurements, via traditional stake methods, provide a tool to quantify Linnebreen’s contribution. Furthermore, mass balance studies shed light on the larger climatic regime of the area during the year of observation and provide a means to determine the “health” of the glacier. Historical records of Linnebreen’s 20th century retreat are preserved in aerial photos. Analysis of photos can give insight into the rate of retreat, providing context for the assessment of Linnebreen’s “health.” As anthropogenic climate change becomes a topic of increasing scientific discussion, especially in the arctic, monitoring such ice masses acquires further significance. This study asks the following questions: What is the current “health” of Linnebreen? How has the beginning of the 21st century compared to the past 100 years? What and when does Linnebreen melt during the summer? What is the main agent of melting? Progress: Completed - Dataset fully collected/analyzed.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Schupack 2007 Mechanisms and Processes of Suspended Sediment Transport and Deposition in High Arctic Proglacial Lake Linnévatnet, Spitsbergen, Svalbard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: High Arctic sedimentary processes in a distal, proglacial lake (Linnévatnet, Spitsbergen, Svalbard) were studied in July and August of 2006 to understand links between climatic controls and suspended sediment entering the lake. Linnévatnet, one of the largest lakes in Svalbard (4.7 km long, 35 m deep), contains sediments dating from the late Pleistocene. Previous studies have attempted to quantify annual sedimentation rates and calibrate the lake’s lamination, however much remains unknown about the suspended sediment entering the lake from the south, and the seasonal mechanisms and processes of sediment deposition into the basin. This study provides a better understanding of summer sedimentation patterns in Linnévatnet, which in turn enables enhanced interpretations of the long-term Svalbard climate record preserved in the Linnévatnet sediment cores. Depth, temperature and transmissivity (turbidity) were recorded in water column profiles by a Seacat SBE 19 profiler over a three-week period. A local automated meteorological station recorded air temperature, wind direction and velocity, precipitation, and solar radiation. Additionally, an automated camera recorded images of the lake inlet to document changes in the inflow stream and the occurrence of surface sediment plumes. Vertical water column profiles reveal that Linnévatnet is dominated by overflow density currents near the lake inlet, while underflow density currents were detected distal to the inlet. Delta turbidity flows were also detected. The sediment plumes fluctuated in great breadth and depth, though they could not be directly constrained to individual meteorological conditions. As a second objective, a baseline study of the Linnévatnet thermal regime was performed. Lake temperatures reached 6.5ºC, surpassing previously speculated temperatures for this High Arctic meltwater lake. Progress: Completed - Dataset fully collected/analyzed.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Stewart 2007 Evidence for Accelerated Surface Melting Rates on the Linné Glacier, Svalbard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Responses of Arctic glaciers and surface lowering can provide a record of glacier mass balance and climate change. High resolution surface lowering, ablation stake, and local meteorological data from Linnébreen Glacier were collected during a twenty one day period during the 2006-2007 ablation year. Linnébreen is located on the Western edge of Spitsbergen, the largest island of the Svalbard archipelago. Ablation stakes located at eight centerlines of Linnébreen recorded surface lowering at eleven different time intervals over the twenty one day field season. Surface lowering and meteorological data; surface air temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and relative humidity, were continuously recorded at 30 minute intervals from ablation stake two. Other records of meteorological data; surface air temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity were recorded approximately 6km down the glacial valley, on a terminal moraine at the LIA maximum, as well as on a lateral moraine near ablation stake seven. These high resolution surface lowering and ablation records were then correlated to meteorological observations. Continued observations of Linnébreen and its surface lowering driving processes will provide more evidence for rapid changes and related glacier response in the high Arctic. Over the period of 23 July to 12 August 2006, the largest surface lowering events were driven by rainfall events. Meteorological records from ablation stake two, as well as down valley show that surface air temperatures do not directly correspond to increased surface lowering; and the peak season temperature does not correspond with the greatest surface lowering response. Rainfall does, however, induce more rapid surface lowering rates, and is the main agent of seasonal ablation. In order to develop a statistical model to accurately estimate the relationships between these variables, Multiple Regression/Correlation (MRC) of surface lowering rates were calculated at each rainfall event. Results suggest that the precipitation events increased the surface lowering rates. Meteorological data within the Linné Valley for the past 3 years indicates that rainfall events have increased in frequency. Given this increase in rainfall events from the past 3 years, Linnébreen’s melting rates reflect not only a seasonal change, but are more likely a response to climate change.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Szembek 2006 Determination of Stratiform Cloud Formation and its Effect upon Glacial Ablation at Linnébreen, Svalbard for the Summer of 2005 Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: The intent of this study is to investigate the formation and organization of Arctic stratiform clouds due to their critical role as a climate forcing mechanism in a warming Polar Basin as well as their impact upon the glacial mass balance. For four weeks in the summer of 2005, meteorological and insolation data were collected at the high-arctic glacier Linnébreen in Svalbard, Norway as part of an NSF funded Research Experience for Undergraduates program. The first portion of this project involves modeling the atmospheric circulation over several nested domains; these domains are scaled from the western Atlantic Arctic region down to the 1km-scale resolving the glacial melt-water basin using the Polar Fifth Generation Mesoscale Model (Polar MM5). Cases were selected based upon dates preceding significant glacial ablation events. The second component of this research focuses upon correlating glacial ablation data with the meteorological observations. With the assistance of the Polar MM5 it is possible to simulate these occurrences, which reveal the moisture and temperature advection as well as the heat budget for the Svalbard region.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Thomas 2005 Using Geochemical Evidence to Determine Provenance in a High Arctic Glacier-Fed Lake, Linné Valley, Svalbard, Norway Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: In the Linné Valley of western Spitsbergen, the Linné glacier (Linnébreen) advanced and retreated throughout the Holocene. Sediment from Linnébreen is deposited into Lake Linné, located 5 km downvalley. Sediment provenance in Linnédalen is being studied as part of the NSF-funded Svalbard REU Project to calibrate lamination stratigraphy in Lake Linné. This valley lends itself to provenance studies because it contains three distinct rock types: carbonate rocks form the eastern mountains, a sandstone with coal seams forms the valley floor and low-grade metamorphic rocks (phyllites) form the western mountains. The principal sediment source streams were identified on aerial photographs. Fine-grained sediment samples were collected from each streambed and source bedrock material was sampled. Lake sediments were taken every 200 m at 1-2 m water depth along the south shoreline where the main inlets enter the lake. The shallow 15 m east basin is fed by the main inlet carrying mainly glacially-derived sediment. The west basin of similar depth is fed primarily by a cirque stream that erodes only phyllites. The 35 m-deep north basin is not fed by any major inlets and is likely dominated by a mix of material carried by currents within the lake and derived from marine terraces on the east and west shores. Distal lake samples were recovered from the top 1-2 cm of short cores taken from these three basins. Loss on ignition is a proxy for provenance: carbon content is high in lake sediments near the Linnébreen meltwater inlet (up to 6.5% weight lost at 550deg C). Carbon content decreases in the west basin as sediment input is dominated by the phyllite-eroding cirque stream. A previous study (Werner 1988) suggests that percent carbon in lake cores may be a proxy for glacier position in the valley. Glacial advances augment weathering of the sandstone/coal formation, causing more carbon deposition in the lake. The geochemical fingerprint of each sample is determined by XRF, with the goal of determining the percent contribution of each source area to the lake. Stream sample compositions are compared to the geochemical composition of layers within lake cores to extrapolate relative source contributions during the late Holocene. Changes in the relative contribution of each source area to the basins are attributed to environmental changes in the valley. Progress: Completed - Dataset fully collected/analyzed.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Tiedmann 2013 Solifluction Lobes as Potential Sediment Contributors to Linnévatnet Spitsbergen Svalbard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: As global changes become more pronounced, arctic regions are increasingly significant in climate studies due to their sensitivity and rapid response to the environment. Svalbard, an arctic archipelago located at 78°N, provides ideal subjects for studying climate history and the impacts of climate change given the abundance of glaciers and continuous permafrost. This study was conducted in western Spitsbergen, Svalbard, as part of a larger project examining climate and sedimentation in the Linnédalen glacio-fluvial-lacustrine system. Sedimentation records in such environments can serve as important proxies of past climate as well as indicators of current climate change, particularly in the preservation of varves. However, in order to interpret such sedimentation patterns, both primary and secondary sources of sediment must be characterized. Soliflucting lobes of relict marine terraces around Linnévatnet were examined and compared to lake cores to identify their potential sediment contribution. This potential input was investigated by mapping the shoreline, deploying short-term sediment traps for the summer 2012 field season, collecting 13 source grab samples, and extracting 5 lake cores. Sieve and laser grain-size analyses were performed on the source samples to further characterize the potential sources. The mineralogical compositions of the lake cores and source samples were analyzed using X-ray diffraction. The grain-size results point to the common original glacio-marine-fjord deposition in this dynamic setting with many sediment inputs. The similar grain-size distributions seen in solifluction samples not only reveal the valley-wide feature of the absence of medium sand(1 to 2φor 0.5 to 0.25 mm), but also help explain the lack of mineralogical variation among the clay fractions of source samples. Variations among the clay fraction of source samples (the fraction potentially reaching lake cores) are observed in the relative abundances of chlorite and illite and appear to reflect proximal bedrock sources. However, these differences do not visibly translate to the 5 lake cores, and all cores maintain similar chlorite:illite ratios, preventing a quantitative assessment of how much each potential source is contributing to the lake cores or whether the solifluction sources are significantly impacting varve analyses.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Tinder 2010 Short-Term Glacial Calving Processes at Kronebreen-Konsvegen, Svalbard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Calving is an important component of glacier mass loss, but it remains difficult to model and directly influences sedimentological processes at the ice margin. As part of the Svalbard REU, this study aims to characterize the short-term calving processes at a tidewater glacier and establish a baseline dataset to which future and contemporary studies can be compared. The study was conducted during two weeks in July and August of 2009 at the head of Kronebreen-Kongsvegen glacier system in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. Two water pressure gauges deployed on the north and south sides of the fjord, adjacent to the glacier face, logged water levels at ten-second intervals. Air pressure and fjord salinity were used to convert water pressure to water depth. The higher frequency water level changes were analyzed to identify large calving events and study their frequency, size, and origin along the calving front. The timing and magnitude of calving events also were compared with potential external forcing mechanisms, such as weather, tidal stage, and local water depth. The pressure-logged wave records were calibrated and confirmed by comparison with observational data from visual logging of calving events at the site. The 15-day study period occurred during the height of the summer melt season. Over the entire record, the frequency of calving events appears to follow the changing tidal amplitude, with reduced calving after the neap tide interval. The observed relationship between calving frequency and tidal stage has been documented at Alaskan glaciers and other locations, and linked causatively by the explanation of increased circulation at the glacier front, as well as the destabilizing effect of buoyancy on the ice front. Fjord water depth at the glacier front influences the formation of “calving bays” where a majority of calving events were observed and the majority of ice loss occurred, as confirmed by satellite imagery. This project is part of a multi-year study of the response of Kronebreen-Kongsvegen to climate change, and also addresses the problem of constraining calving mechanisms and dynamics. Proper methodology in association with deployment of multiple water depth/pressure loggers placed close to a calving glacier terminus are recommended as an effective means of studying calving processes at a high resolution over various time intervals.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Trusel 2006 Fjord Sedimentation Associated with a Submarine Jet and Plume Discharging into Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, Norway Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Kronebreen is a fast flowing, but actively retreating, tidewater glacier that terminates at the head of Kongsfjorden in Western Spitsbergen, Svalbard, Norway. Currently, one main subglacial meltwater conduit marked by a terminus embayment forcefully releases fresh water into the fjord. Basal meltwater and debris, evident from very high suspended sediment concentrations of up to 0.22 g L-1 (mean conc. at ≥ 10m depth = 0.1 g L-1) rapidly exit the glacier, forming a density-controlled turbid upwelling from the grounding line at about 60 m depth. Sediment, as coarse as fine sand, is actively transported to the fjord surface and then quickly falls out of suspension. Silt and clay, however, spread laterally above the pycnocline at 10-12 m depth and are transported down-fjord. At about 240 m from the ice cliff and near the meltwater upwelling, the minimum measured sediment mass accumulation rate is 39.62 ± 0.01 g cm-2 a-1 (0.66 g cm-2 d-1; 5.0 mm d-1 vertical dry accumulation rate), and the rate decreases with distance from the ice cliff. Gravity cores taken at distances 630 m and 970 m from the calving margin indicate turbidity current activity beyond the modern morainal bank and adjacent subaqueous grounding-line fan. The base of each turbidite is marked by an increase in mean grain size coincident with an increased magnetic susceptibility. Mapping of the ice margin in 2005 indicates a slowing ice margin retreat rate (21 m a-1 between 1990 and 2005) in comparison with recent decades. This slowing trend may indicate increased overall ice flow rate or the possibility of the glacier beginning to pull out of the fjord. Our field work was conducted in July 2005 as part of the Svalbard REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) program funded by the US National Science Foundation. The research is aimed at using glacimarine sedimentation as a proxy for modern climate change. Additionally, because of polar amplification in the climate system, studies of regional change expressed in glacial processes throughout the Arctic region are of interest for understanding the heterogeneous impacts of contemporary change. Field methods included use of suspended sediment traps, CTD/OBS instrumentation, water sampling, gravity and box coring, sub-bottom profiling, and iceberg sampling. Our sediment traps measured the highest sedimentation rates recorded in the fjord, but comparison between our measurements and previous studies is problematic for various reasons. However, measured sedimentation rates confirm these glaciers lie on a climatological spectrum between fully cold-based glaciers of Antarctica and warm-based glaciers of Alaska today.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Valletta 2012 Monitoring Fjord-Floor Sedimentology and Geochemistry in an Ice-Proximal Region: A Case Study from the Kronebreen-Kongsvegen Confluent Tidewater Glacial System Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: During the summer 2011 Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, six students led by two research scientists traveled to the island of Spitsbergen, Svalbard and collected six sediment cores across the face of a tidewater glacial system. Ice-proximal (<500 m from the ice face) sedimentation at the Kronebreen-Kongsvegen ice face has been well studied through the REU program, but never before has geochemical data been considered. Voluminous sediment originates from two sources at this site: a subglacial river at mid-ice face and an ice marginal stream at its southern terminus . This study uses both sedimentological and geochemical methods to better characterize sediment sourcing and depositional trends across the ice face. Core analyses included manual descriptions, granulometry, and comparison of GRAPE density measurements, magnetic susceptibility profiles and x-radiographs. Additionally, x-ray fluorescence (XRF) detection scans provide high-resolution down-core relative element abundances for the sediment cores. Down-core ratios of major and minor elements provide information on sediment organic matter content, turbidite deposits, and grain size trends. Quantitative analyses were made possible using principal component analysis (PCA), a statistical analysis tool that isolates dominant factors in a data matrix into ‘factor loadings’. PCA was used on XRF datasets to isolate dominant elements and geochemical signatures of sediments from each source. In all cores, Fe, K, Mn, and Rb or Ti comprise a factor loadingthat represents the sediment clay-size fraction. Ti is highly correlated (76.6%) in mid-ice face clays, and Rb is highly correlated (82.3%) in delta-proximal clays. Si, Ca and Ti comprise a second factor loading representative of a larger grain-size fraction by the delta deposited by the ice-marginal stream. Ca is highly correlated with Si and Ti (97.9%) in grey silty-sands, but on its own comprises a third factor loading in red muds (17% total variance), perhaps representing erosive activity rather than a particular grain size. This evidence suggests that alternating red muds and grey silty sands deposited ahead of the delta represent two different sediment sources rather than distinct depositional processes. This research lays the groundwork for further statistically rigorous testing of XRF geochemical datasets, useful for understanding sedimentation in the tidewater periglacial environment.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Wei 2011 Analysis of Varved Sediment and Weather Relationships in Lake Linné, Svalbard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: The debate involving climate change has become increasingly important in the recent decade. Arctic environments are important locations for study as they are particularly sensitive to climate variations. Proglacial lake sediments, particularly varves, such as those found at Lake Linné, on the island of Spitsbergen, Svalbard, demonstrate this sensitivity as they are driven by glacial ablation. The correlation of cores from different locations in Lake Linné has served to address inconsistencies in the varve record across the lake. The relationship between measured varve thickness and weather parameters is based on meteorological records for the past century, and demonstrates the responsiveness of varves to changes in climate and weather. The strongest relationships between varves and weather were between positive degree estimates and varve thicknesses. Proximal locations showed the strongest values (r-squared = 0.331), while summer thickness measurements at an intermediate deep basin site correlated best with the past two decades (r-squared = 0.45). The measuring and counting of varves allowed the construction of a chronology that then serves as a climate proxy for Svalbard for the past century. The varve analysis from this study reveals the complexity of the sedimentation in Lake Linné, and it attempts to define the other likely factors that contribute to varve deposition. Overall, the assembled climate relationships reveal varves which can be linked to changes in weather and climate patterns, and a response of the Lake Linné proglacial system in the last two decades to climate change.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Wei Haas 2009 Geochemical Investigation of Weathering in a High Arctic Watershed and Provenance of Sediments in Kongressvatnet, Svalbard, Norway Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: This study uses changes in the chemistry and mineralogy of lake and surface sediments in a small lake in Kongress Valley (Kongressdalen), to interpret Late Holocene climate change in Western Spitsbergen, Svalbard. Changes in clay mineralogy across an inactive outwash fan (Black Fan) in the valley reflect weathering since the fan’s formation during the Little Ice Age (LIA) (1550-1920). X-Ray Diffraction analysis of clay samples from the meltwater channels and the Kapp Starostin rocks that compose the fan reveal a strong 10 Å peak, unaffected by ethylene glycol solvation or heating to 375°C and 550 °C, indicative of illite. However, samples collected from vegetated debris flows between the meltwater channels reveal a diminished 10 Å phase and a slightly expandable peak at approximately 14 Å, unaffected by magnesium and glycerol saturation (d 060 of 1.54 Å), indicative of vermiculite. The inverse relationship between these peaks reflects the weathering of illite to vermiculite, suggesting an early period of Kapp Starostin Fm. deposition subsequently eroded by meltwater from Kongressbreen (glacier) during the LIA. Changes in lake sediment chemistry should reflect changing sources of sediment inflow as meltwater from an advancing ice activated the Black Fan. X-Ray Fluorescence analysis of the White and Black Fan, which are the only sources of sediment inflow to the lake, reveals that the Black Fan sediments have greater concentrations of K2O, Fe2O3,Zr, and Cr, while the White Fan is characterized by higher concentrations of MgO, CaO, Sr, and U. However, analysis of sediment cores from the central part of the lake reveals a chemical composition that resembles only that of the White Fan sediment, indicating almost no Black Fan input into Kongressvatnet. The most likely hypothesis to explain this absence is that Kongressbreen was a cold-based glacier and therefore did not produce fine glacial flour from scour of bedrock. Despite the dominant White Fan signature in the core sediments, ITRAX Scanning XRay Fluorescence analysis reveals significant variations in core chemistry with depth, which is likely due to changes in climate. Periodic, massive high calcium layers, lacking internal laminations characterize the upper 200 mm of the core, which correlates using MS to cores dated to the LIA (Guilizzoni et al., 2006). Preliminary SEM analysis reveals the presence of euhedral, sharp-edged rhombohedra and fibrous needles of calcite, high-Mg calcite, and dolomite, suggesting the precipitation of carbonate. The current supersaturation of Kongressvatnet waters below the chemocline with respect to calcite further supports this hypothesis. Alternatively, periods of extended ice cover during which the formation of lake ice concentrates the calcium in the underlying lake water, and may result in the formation of cryogenic calcite. Anomalous peaks in iron and sulfur characterize the lower core (300-400 mm), which MS correlations indicate corresponds to the Medieval Warm Period (Guilizzoni et al., 2006). An increase in organic terriginous inflow during this period likely spurs the activity of sulfur reducing bacteria, resulting in reducing conditions and the precipitation of iron sulfides. This analysis suggests that although provenance cannot be used in Kongressvatnet to constrain the timing of the Little Ice Age, changes in climate are intimately associated with fluctuations in lake chemistry and thelake’s biogeochemical cycles, providing the opportunity to interpret past climate change from lake sediment chemistry.

Bigelow James Beget Principal Investigator: Yuri Shur Description: NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT for Collaborative Research: Forty-Thousand Years of Yedoma (ARC 1107571) An investigation into the spatial heterogeneity and paleo-history of organic-rich permafrost in Alaska A new permafrost tunnel 4 m high and 30 m long was excavated near Fox, Alaska in 2011. It is adjacent to the older and widely known CRREL tunnel. The new tunnel penetrates yedoma (loess or silt) deposits ranging from modern to more than 40,000 years old. Beautifully exposed in the walls of the tunnel are a series of ice wedges, thermokarst-cave ice, and paleosols that record the climatic and ecological history of central Alaska since the last Ice Age. We propose to map and sample these sediments using a variety of analysis techniques, including extensive AMS radiocarbon dating to reveal environmental conditions during the yedoma formation. We will use the results to reconstruct the paleo-climatic and environmental history of the central Alaska region, a region that during the past 40,000 years has been cold enough to produce and support permafrost, but where now permafrost is thawing. The expected results will not only tell us about how climate has varied in Alaska during this critical period, but also in the other yedoma regions of the world which include Siberia and Canada. The new tunnel will be used as a classroom for students in geology and environmental engineering. Progress: Completed - Dataset fully collected/analyzed.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Yellen 2006 Summer Time Suspended Sediment Transport in Lake Linné, Svalbard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Conclusions: Several forces affect summer time suspended sediment transport within Lake Linné. Most notably, surface winds and associated Ekman transport drive currents easterly or westerly on a daily basis. Melting of the delta icing over the course of the summer allows a progressively larger channel to flow out of the eastern side of the inlet delta. Depth distribution of sediment plumes is predictably influenced by density contrasts between the inlet water and the lake water. During times of low flow, when the glacial melt water is most concentrated, underflows tend to occur. Conversely, during wetter periods, when the glacial sediment is diluted by surface run off, overflows may be more common. The effects of the secular eastward shift of suspended sediment may provide a robust paleo-indicator for summer climate if detected in the paleo record. Further work must be done to better understand the effects of daily changes in sediment distribution throughout the summer. Most notably, detailed observations of the inlet delta throughout the summer will allow for more confidence regarding the influence of the icing in biasing the direction of the inlet plume. Additionally, monitoring sediment plumes in along the long axis of the lake may allow for better understanding of where sediment travels within the lake. Due to the importance of summertime climate in the Arctic’s energy budget and our ability to directly observe sedimentation at this time of the year, a better understanding of summer sedimentation controls will provide the most useful interpretation of Linné’s paleo record.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Zamora 2010 Using Sediment Geochemistry, Particle Size Distribution and Remote Sensing to Study Provenance in the Kronebreen/Kongsvegen Glaciers, West Spitsbergen, Svalbard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Sediment provenance at the Kronerbreen/Kongsvegen glaciers in Spitsbergen can be used to understand the effects that climate change can have on the sedimentation in fjords, and streams at northern latitudes. These sediments are directly related to glacial processes and reflect the conditions under which they formed. Such conditions are sensitive to global climate change, which is amplified in northern latitudes, creating a unique environment for climate change research. Quantitative provenance studies have never been carried out in the Kongsfjorden before, and can provide data for a better understanding of glacial processes and dynamics, and changes in erosional conditions. Particularly, sedimentation rates and sediment grain size distribution can help unravel the glacial history of the area. This study will focus on analyzing the grain size distribution of the material being deposited by the mentioned glaciers and finding the source rock of these sediments. Fine sediment was transported by streams and upflows identified in the field, and fed by the glaciers melting ice. On the other hand, coarser material ranging from cobble to boulder size was deposited by ice, moraines, and alluvial processes. Sediment and rock samples were collected during the months of July and August 2009, along the terminus of the glacier, and in the surrounding areas, respectively. Grain size analysis was performed on the samples using a Malvern Mastersizer with the resulting in different groups showing a change in particle size and sorting depending on the location along the glacier. This analysis is important as mineral composition and transportation is influenced by grain size. Electron microprobe studies were carried out on sediment grains to obtain a rough compositional profile of the sediments, and a first-order mineralogical make-up. The microprobe results provided us with information about composition of some of the minerals present, based on the content of Fe, Ca, K and Al derived from the erosion of the local lithologies. Chemical composition can distinguish sediments derived from different sources, and may ultimately be compared with representative rock samples taken from the moraines. Due to the limited accessibility to some areas, many geological units in the Kongsfjorden area have not been mapped or studied, limiting the possible comparisons with contributing material to the fjord’s seafloor. Remote sensing techniques were used to map lithologies in previously unmapped regions using ENVI®, and ASTER satellite imagery. A GER 3700 radiospectrometer was used to collect spectral properties of the rock samples. These properties were compared to the outcrops in the satellite imagery giving us an idea of the bedrock composition of the area. The results of our research can be compared with future studies in order to obtain information, regarding responses in the glacier dynamics and processes, related to climate change.

Dataset The Svalbard REU: Holocene and Modern Climate Change in the High Arctic             Svalbard REU program undergraduate student theses   Zamora 2011 The Role of Underflows and Weather on Sediment Distribution in Glacial-Fed Lake Linné, Svalbard, Norway Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Description: Abstract: Linnévatnet (78° 2’N, 13° 49’E), is a glacial-fed lake located in Svalbard, an archipelago north of Norway. Sediments found in the lake are supplied by the Linné Glacier, 8km south of the lake, and are transported by the melt stream into the lake, creating laminations with a strong signal of seasonal deposition. Due to its immaculate environment and recent rapid increase in temperature, this site is an ideal place to study past-climate proxies and determine how the changing environment is affecting the area. The objective of this study is to determine the frequency of water underflows influencing sediment distribution and how they are related to weather patterns. Loggers recorded water temperature at 6 depths in 2 separate stations; weather was logged at an adjacent weather station. Underflow events, identified based on large changes in water temperature at the deepest loggers, were most common near the stream inflow. These events were most often correlated with changes in wind direction, wind speed and precipitation. In the future, underflows will be compared to time-lapse pictures of the lake, data of an intervalometer - which records the amount of sedimentation- and tilt data to see how lake processes affect sedimentation distribution throughout the lake.

Svalbard, an arctic archipelago located at 78°N, provides ideal subjects for studying climate history and the impacts of climate change given the abundance of glaciers and continuous permafrost. This study was conducted in western Spitsbergen, Svalbard, as part of a larger project examining climate and sedimentation... Reusché 2013 Holocene fluctuations of Linné Glacier: constraining its pre-Little Ice Age history using cosmogenic radionuclide exposure dating Dataset Abstract: As is observable today, Arctic glaciers are especially sensitive to climate change. By studying the past fluctuations in glacier extent, we can determine the cause of these fluctuations due to climatic shifts in temperature, albedo, and green house gas accumulation. Here, we investigate the fluctuations of Linnebreen, a high Arctic glacier located in southwestern Spitsbergen, Svalbard, throughout the Holocene in order to investigate its reaction to the cooling temperatures seen in... Nussbaum 2013 A Temporal Analysis of Suspended Sediment Concentration Changes in A Proglacial Meltwater Stream, Linnébreen, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: Data suggest that climate change has significantly affected and will continue to affect global environments. Furthermore, research suggests that the current warming trend will continue, and it is therefore important to study current environmental systems in order to understand the complicated dynamics of warming and response (Parry, Canziani, Palutikof, van der Linden, & Hanson, 2007). Arctic environments are particularly sensitive to climate change, and are therefore a critical area... Valletta 2012 Monitoring Fjord-Floor Sedimentology and Geochemistry in an Ice-Proximal Region: A Case Study from the Kronebreen-Kongsvegen Confluent Tidewater Glacial System Dataset Abstract: During the summer 2011 Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, six students led by two research scientists traveled to the island of Spitsbergen, Svalbard and collected six sediment cores across the face of a tidewater glacial system. Ice-proximal (<500 m from the ice face) sedimentation at the Kronebreen-Kongsvegen ice face has been well studied through the REU program, but never before has geochemical data been considered. Voluminous sediment originates from two... Roth 2012 Submarine Landforms in a Surge-Type Tidewater Glacier Regime, Engelskbukta, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: Though surge-type glaciers make up a small percentage of the world’s outlet glaciers, they have the potential to further destabilize the larger ice caps and ice sheets that feed them during a surge. Currently, mechanics that control the duration and ice flux from a surge remain poorly understood. Here, we examine submarine glacial landforms in bathymetric data from Engelskbukta, a bay sculpted by the advance and retreat of Comfortlessbreen, a surge-type glacier in Svalbard, a high... Rajagopalan 2012 Characterizing Fjord Oceanography near Tidewater Glaciers Kronebreen and Kongsvegen, in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: In recent years, warmer Atlantic-origin waters have intruded into Svalbard's westcoast fjords. To predict the effect of the TAW (transformed Atlantic water) intrusion on the ice margin of tidewater glaciers, a detailed understanding of fjord circulation is important. While the general fjord circulation of Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, is well understood, water masses closest to the ice margin {and directly responsible for submarine glacial melt {are more difficult to study. To characterize... McGregor 2012 Gravity Core Geochemistry at the Kronebreen Glacier, Svalbard, Norway: Quantifying Climate Flux in a Glacimarine Setting Dataset Abstract: During the present period of significant climate flux, scientists are attempting to understand and constrain the way in which Earth responds to these changes, as well as what these changes mean for life on the planet. The polar regions (the Arctic and Antarctic) are particularly sensitive to climatic perturbations, and they house extensive evidence of the impact that warming has had in the past, from changing ocean chemistries to the relationship between glacial retreat and... Ceperley 2012 Using Clay Mineralogy to Analyze Sediment Sources, Kronebreen and Kongsvegen Glaciers, Svalbard, Norway Dataset Abstract: Svalbard is a Norwegian island archipelago located at 79°N whose glaciers are highly susceptible to climate fluctuations. Glaciers located in Svalbard sit between warm water from the south and cold polar water from the north. This position increases their sensitivity to climate fluctuations. Due to amplified and continuous climatic warming at high latitudes, the glaciers of Svalbard are prime subjects for understanding not only glacial dynamics, but also the effects of contemporary... Wei 2011 Analysis of Varved Sediment and Weather Relationships in Lake Linné, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: The debate involving climate change has become increasingly important in the recent decade. Arctic environments are important locations for study as they are particularly sensitive to climate variations. Proglacial lake sediments, particularly varves, such as those found at Lake Linné, on the island of Spitsbergen, Svalbard, demonstrate this sensitivity as they are driven by glacial ablation. The correlation of cores from different locations in Lake Linné has served to address... Zamora 2011 The Role of Underflows and Weather on Sediment Distribution in Glacial-Fed Lake Linné, Svalbard, Norway Dataset Abstract: Linnévatnet (78° 2’N, 13° 49’E), is a glacial-fed lake located in Svalbard, an archipelago north of Norway. Sediments found in the lake are supplied by the Linné Glacier, 8km south of the lake, and are transported by the melt stream into the lake, creating laminations with a strong signal of seasonal deposition. Due to its immaculate environment and recent rapid increase in temperature, this site is an ideal place to study past-climate proxies and determine how the ... Pendleton 2011 The Glaciofluvial Environment of Linnébreen, Spitsbergen, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: Suspended sediment concentrations (SSC), meltwater discharge and local climatic conditions of the Linné glaciofluvial system were monitored from July 21 to August 9, 2010 in order to determine the temporal relationships between local climate, glacier melting and sediment production. ISCO water samplers were installed along the main meltwater channel to record SSC. SSC was directly related to discharge of the glaciofluvial system, which was in turn dependent on melt of the Linné... Magnabosco 2011 A Characterization of the Biology and Nutrient Cycling of Two Glacial Lakes in Isfjord Radio, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: Due to the fact that lakes in the high arctic are only exposed for two to three months out of the year, very little is known about the microbiology and nutrient cycling that occur in this region. Of greatest interest in these high arctic regions are the primary producers that control the majority of the biogeochemical cycling and carbon dioxide sequestration of the region. Therefore, it is important to understand how industrialization of the 20th and 21st centuries is affecting these... DeWet 2011 Analysis of Sediment Trap Yields in Glacial Fed Linnévatnet, Svalbard: Calibrating Watershed and Lacustrine Processes for Paleoclimate Analysis Dataset Abstract: Annually laminated lake sediments provide valuable high resolution records of paleoclimate in areas such as the High Arctic where detailed records are generally lacking. Studies of lacustrine sediment deposition and watershed dynamics allow for interpretation or calibration of the annual sediment yields and the connection to climatic controls. Sediment trap studies undertaken on Linnévatnet, a High Arctic glacial-fed lake on the largest island of the Svalbard archipelago, since 2003... Vaillencourt 2010 Alkenone-Inferred Temperature Reconstruction from Kongressvatnet, Svalbard Dataset For published version, see D’Andrea, W.J., Vaillencourt, D.A., Balascio, N.L., Werner, A., Roof, S.R., Retelle, M., and Bradley, R.S., 2012, Mild Little Ice Age and unprecedented recent warmth in an 1800 year lake sediment record from Svalbard: Geology, v. 40, p. 1055–1056, doi: 10.1130/G33365.1. Zamora 2010 Using Sediment Geochemistry, Particle Size Distribution and Remote Sensing to Study Provenance in the Kronebreen/Kongsvegen Glaciers, West Spitsbergen, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: Sediment provenance at the Kronerbreen/Kongsvegen glaciers in Spitsbergen can be used to understand the effects that climate change can have on the sedimentation in fjords, and streams at northern latitudes. These sediments are directly related to glacial processes and reflect the conditions under which they formed. Such conditions are sensitive to global climate change, which is amplified in northern latitudes, creating a unique environment for climate change research. ... Tinder 2010 Short-Term Glacial Calving Processes at Kronebreen-Konsvegen, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: Calving is an important component of glacier mass loss, but it remains difficult to model and directly influences sedimentological processes at the ice margin. As part of the Svalbard REU, this study aims to characterize the short-term calving processes at a tidewater glacier and establish a baseline dataset to which future and contemporary studies can be compared. The study was conducted during two weeks in July and August of 2009 at the head of Kronebreen-Kongsvegen glacier system... Poppick 2010 Modern Depositional Processes Proximal to a Polythermal Tidewater Glacier Complex, Kronebreen -Kongsvegen, Kongsfjorden: Svalbard, Norway Dataset Abstract: A series of sediment gravity- and box-cores was collected in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard during the summer of 2009 as part of the Svalbard Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) project, which aims to characterize the modern sedimentary environment proximal to the Kronebreen-Kongsvegen tidewater glacier margin. This study serves to generate baseline data for future assessment of the local polythermal glacial response to climate change, and to contribute to the framework by which... Nereson 2010 Sedimentation Rates in the Distal Basin of Arctic Proglacial Linnévatnet, Western Spitsbergen, Svalbard: Evidence from Radioactive Fallout Cesium-137 Dataset Abstract: The rhythmically laminated sediments found in proglacial Linnévatnet in western Spitsbergen, Svalbard may be suitable for the reconstruction of paleoenvironmental conditions such as temperature, precipitation, and glacier mass balance. In order to use these sediments as a proxy for past environmental change, however, we must understand which modern environmental factors contribute to Linnévatnet’s patterned sediments. The goal of this study is to further that... Nelson 2010 A Varved Sediment Analysis of 1,000 Years of Climate Change: Linnévatnet, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: In July 2009, we recovered a varved sediment core from 35 m in the deep main basin of Linnévatnet, a high Arctic glacial lake in Svalbard. Arctic lakes are key locations for studying climate records because the Arctic is highly sensitive to climate change and because varves reflect seasonal and annual sedimentation rates. Previous research in Linnévatnet has focused primarily on the proximal basin near the Linnéelva (Linné River) inlet where it is difficult to distinguish annual... Kehrl 2010 Quantifying Sedimentation Processes and Rates through Repeat Bathymetry at Kronebreen and Kongsvegen Glaciers, Svalbard, Norway Dataset For published version, see Kehrl, L.M., Hawley, R.L., Powell, R.D., and Brigham-Grette, J., 2011, Glacimarine sedimentation processes at Kronebreen and Kongsvegen, Svalbard: Journal of Glaciology, v. 57, p. 841–847. Marshburn 2010 Glaciomarine Oceanographic and Suspended Sediment Dynamics, Kongsbreen system, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: Quantifying estuarine circulation and the resulting sediment dynamics of tidewater glaciers is crucial to developing an understanding of these dynamic systems, and their response to climate and sea level change. This study characterizes oceanographic conditions and suspended sediment loads resulting from glacial meltwater in proximal distance to the glacier terminus of the Kronebreen-Kongsvegen system, Kongsfjorden, Svalbard as a component of the Svalbard REU project. The study was... Hittson 2010 Cryoconite Evolution and Formation on an Arctic Glacier Surface: A Case Study and Model Dataset Abstract: Cryoconite holes are vertical cylindrical holes that form on glacier surfaces due to the lower albedo of sediments. Cryoconite holes exist on Linnebreen, Svalbard over the entirety of the glacier. They preferentially melt below the surrounding glacier surface and eventually create standing water above them. In this study, six cryoconite holes were created by placing sediments on the glacier surface and observing their growth and movement for a period of fourteen days. They ranged... Barnhart 2010 Glaciomarine Sediment Flux and Transportation Mechanisms, Kronebreen/Kongsvegen, Kongsfjorden, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: Arctic tidewater glaciers are likely to respond rapidly to changes in climate, due to a variety of climate forcing mechanisms. This study is designed to assess how these glaciers are now responding to these changes. We collected marine sediment samples near Kronebreen/Kongsvegan, a polythermal subpolar tidewater glacier in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, over the summer melt season of 2009. CTD/OBS and meteorological data were also collected to characterize this dynamic Arctic system.... Wei Haas 2009 Geochemical Investigation of Weathering in a High Arctic Watershed and Provenance of Sediments in Kongressvatnet, Svalbard, Norway Dataset Abstract: This study uses changes in the chemistry and mineralogy of lake and surface sediments in a small lake in Kongress Valley (Kongressdalen), to interpret Late Holocene climate change in Western Spitsbergen, Svalbard. Changes in clay mineralogy across an inactive outwash fan (Black Fan) in the valley reflect weathering since the fan’s formation during the Little Ice Age (LIA) (1550-1920). X-Ray Diffraction analysis of clay samples from the meltwater channels and the Kapp Starostin... Mitchell 2009 Mechanisms of Glacial Ablation at Linnébreen, Svalbard, Norwegian Arctic Dataset Abstract: Modern glacial process studies on Arctic glaciers provide valuable information on responses to climate change in high latitudes, and may also suggest eventual implications for lower latitudes. Most Arctic glaciers exist at higher air temperatures than Antarctic glaciers, and are thus likely to show a more rapid response to global climate change. Understanding factors that influence glacier mass balance and quantifying ablation dynamics provide useful data to document the Arctic’s... Pompeani 2009 A 360 year Varve-Based Climate Reconstruction from Linnévatnet on Western Svalbard Dataset [Metadata only] Abstract: Linnévatnet (78.05° N; 13.8° E; 12 m asl) is a proglacial lake located on the western coast of Spitsbergen, the largest island of the Svalbard archipelago. The 5.75 km² lake is set in a 35.3 km² catchment and fed by the glacier, Linnébreen, (1.7 km²) along with several small cirque glaciers. Currently, Linnébreen covers roughly 5% of the watershed in the valley of Linnédalen. The vast majority of sediment is moved into the lake during the early summer snow melt; however,... Mortazavi 2009 Chronology and Correlations of High Arctic Lakes Based on Magnetic Properties Dataset Abstract: Located at 78ºN, the island of Spitsbergen is covered by small glacal lakes. Linnévatent and Kongressvanet are two such lakes and are separated by about five kilometers along the western coast. These lakes have been part of an ongoing study to better understand the present and past climate changes. Chronology for cores recovered from these lakes is especially hard to establish, due to large amounts of detrial coal as well as the depletion of 14 C due to carbonate dissolution make 14... Arnold 2009 Sedimentation in High-Arctic Lake, Linnévatnet, Svalbard: A Modern Process Study Using Sediment Traps Dataset Abstract: Linnévatnet is a High Arctic glacier-fed lake in Svalbard in which past climatic characteristics are recorded in laminated lake sediments that likely span the past 9,000 years. The laminae are comprised of annual terrigenous couplets consisting of distinct coarse summer and fine winter layers. Previous studies in similar proglacial lakes throughout the Arctic and alpine regions have determined that varves of this type may record an archive of past weather and climatic influences in... Cobin 2008 Evaluation of Modern Sedimentation Processes in a Proglacial Lake: Linnévatnet, Spitsbergen, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: Cores from proglacial lake, Lake Linné, on Svalbard contain varves that hold important information about past climate change. By establishing a relationship between modern sedimentation and measured environmental conditions, we hope to calibrate the late Holocene sediment record found in Lake Linné. Since 2003 sediment trap moorings at five locations in the lake have provided proximal to distal records of overall lake sedimentation. Each mooring also had multiple traps positioned at... Stewart 2007 Evidence for Accelerated Surface Melting Rates on the Linné Glacier, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: Responses of Arctic glaciers and surface lowering can provide a record of glacier mass balance and climate change. High resolution surface lowering, ablation stake, and local meteorological data from Linnébreen Glacier were collected during a twenty one day period during the 2006-2007 ablation year. Linnébreen is located on the Western edge of Spitsbergen, the largest island of the Svalbard archipelago. Ablation stakes located at eight centerlines of Linnébreen recorded surface... Schupack 2007 Mechanisms and Processes of Suspended Sediment Transport and Deposition in High Arctic Proglacial Lake Linnévatnet, Spitsbergen, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: High Arctic sedimentary processes in a distal, proglacial lake (Linnévatnet, Spitsbergen, Svalbard) were studied in July and August of 2006 to understand links between climatic controls and suspended sediment entering the lake. Linnévatnet, one of the largest lakes in Svalbard (4.7 km long, 35 m deep), contains sediments dating from the late Pleistocene. Previous studies have attempted to quantify annual sedimentation rates and calibrate the lake’s lamination, however much... Roop 2007 Sedimentation in a Proglacial Lake: Interpreting Intra- and Inter-Annual Sedimentation in Linnévatnet, Spitsbergen, Norway Dataset Abstract: As part of the larger National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates on Svalbard (NSF-REU) project, this study focuses on lake sediment distribution processes and sediment flux during the 2005-2006 melt year. Using an array of vertically and spatially distributed sediment traps, the collected sediments have been related to local meteorological conditions and melt-water inputs. Five mooring sites were established both proximal and distal to the primary inflow,... Leon 2007 Comparison of Lamination Stratigraphies in Cores Recovered from Different Locations in Linnévatnet, Svalbard, Norway Dataset Abstract: Due to the sensitivity of high latitude regions to global climate change, it is important to understand the role and response of the arctic environment to past climatic events. Lacustrine sediments can provide a useful archive of past environmental change preserved in structural, textural, and compositional variation. Linnévatnet, a large proglacial lake on Svalbard in the Norwegian High Arctic, contains a long record of annually laminated (varved) sediments. This study provides a... Helfrich 2007 Glacial Ablation Dynamics and Sediment Flux at Linnébreen, Spitsbergen Dataset Abstract: Modern process studies conducted on Arctic glaciers provide valuable insight into dynamic responses observed in the high latitudes due to global scale climate change, with telltale implications for environmental change in the lower latitudes. This research was conducted on Spitsbergen, the largest island of Svalbard, as part of an NSF funded Research Experience for Undergraduates program. The Norwegian High Arctic, containing Svalbard, is influenced by the northern extent of... Carr 2007 Suspended Sediment Transport in Proglacial Linnéelva, Spitsbergen Dataset Abstract: Suspended sediment concentration and discharge measurements from the proglacial stream Linnéelva are reported for a three week period during the 2006 melt season. This period included a threshold discharge event in which suspended sediment concentration increased dramatically, resulting in 25% of total monitored sediment transport occurring in less than 3% (15 hours) of the total monitored time period. This appears to have been a sediment flushing event, with the system displaying... Anderson 2007 Surficial Geology of the Kongressvatnet Catchment, Svalbard, Norway Dataset Abstract: This study analyses the active geomorphic processes and the geological events recorded the landscape around Kongressvatnet, an arctic, meromictic lake located in western Spitsbergen (the largest island in Svalbard). This geomorphic analysis is in collaboration with a short core analysis of sediments from the lake. The interpretation and comparison of the lacustrine sediment record and the surficial geology record of Kongressvatnet will draw conclusions about past climate variation in... Alden 2007 Glacial History of the Little Ice Age in Kongress Valley, Svalbard: a study of lacustrine sediment Dataset Abstract: Lake sediment cores from proglacial lakes can provide a detailed if indirect record of past glacial history and therefore past climate variations. This study involves analysis of a core from Kongressvatnet, a small lake in Kongress Valley on the high-arctic archipelago of Svalbard. Multiple characteristics of the core are examined in order to reconstruct the glacial history of the valley. There are three major questions that this study seeks to address: 1) whether during the Little... Yellen 2006 Summer Time Suspended Sediment Transport in Lake Linné, Svalbard Dataset Conclusions: Several forces affect summer time suspended sediment transport within Lake Linné. Most notably, surface winds and associated Ekman transport drive currents easterly or westerly on a daily basis. Melting of the delta icing over the course of the summer allows a progressively larger channel to flow out of the eastern side of the inlet delta. Depth distribution of sediment plumes is predictably influenced by density contrasts between the inlet water and the lake water. During... Trusel 2006 Fjord Sedimentation Associated with a Submarine Jet and Plume Discharging into Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, Norway Dataset Abstract: Kronebreen is a fast flowing, but actively retreating, tidewater glacier that terminates at the head of Kongsfjorden in Western Spitsbergen, Svalbard, Norway. Currently, one main subglacial meltwater conduit marked by a terminus embayment forcefully releases fresh water into the fjord. Basal meltwater and debris, evident from very high suspended sediment concentrations of up to 0.22 g L-1 (mean conc. at ≥ 10m depth = 0.1 g L-1) rapidly exit the glacier, forming a... Szembek 2006 Determination of Stratiform Cloud Formation and its Effect upon Glacial Ablation at Linnébreen, Svalbard for the Summer of 2005 Dataset Abstract: The intent of this study is to investigate the formation and organization of Arctic stratiform clouds due to their critical role as a climate forcing mechanism in a warming Polar Basin as well as their impact upon the glacial mass balance. For four weeks in the summer of 2005, meteorological and insolation data were collected at the high-arctic glacier Linnébreen in Svalbard, Norway as part of an NSF funded Research Experience for Undergraduates program. The first portion of this... Perrault 2006 Mineralogical Analysis of Primary and Secondary Source Sediments to Linnévatnet, Spitsbergen, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: Linnévatnet, Spitsbergen, Svalbard is a high Arctic lake containing a sediment record that extends through most of the Holocene. Laminated lake sediments such as those found in Linnévatnet can serve as high resolution proxies for long term climate change. This study utilizes detailed mineralogical analysis to identify changes in the source of sediments to Linnévatnet during the late Holocene. These climatically sensitive sediment sources include a major proglacial river; alluvial...

Moore 2006 Hydrochemical Study of the Linnebreen Catchment Dataset Few details are available for this thesis. See files for short report and some figures. Matell 2006 Sediment Dynamics Between the Glacier Linnébreen and its Lake Linnévatnet in the European High Arctic Dataset Nora studied the processes associated with sediment flux down the Linne' meltwater system during the summer of 2005. She related suspended sediment load to weather parameters, glacier ablation and river stage/discharge Gercke 2006 Relationships among Weather, Glacial Ablation, and Fluvial Processes, Svalbard, Norway Dataset Abstract: The influence of weather factors on glacier ablation is a topic of much debate in arctic scientific literature. Corresponding studies of glacier meltwater and stream suspended sediment characteristics are also common, but results vary with study location. This study aims to characterize the Linné valley in terms of seasonal glacial and fluvial patterns, and examine the effect of these parameters on sedimentation in Lake Linné. This study will contribute to the understanding of... Cumpstson 2006 Ice-Marginal Delta Formation and Sedimentary Processes Of Kongsvegen Glacier in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, Norway Dataset Abstract: Over the last ca. 15 years, the southeastern portion of Kongsvegen glacier has retreated back onto land and an ice-marginal delta has formed at its terminus. The delta has an annual growth rate of 6.0x105 m3 a-1, determined from bathymetric profiling and aerial photos taken inbound and outbound of Ny Ålesund. Sedimentation in Kongsfjorden, where the subglacial derived meltwater stream discharges after flowing over the delta, were recorded, from sediment traps located at the given... Thomas 2005 Using Geochemical Evidence to Determine Provenance in a High Arctic Glacier-Fed Lake, Linné Valley, Svalbard, Norway Dataset Abstract: In the Linné Valley of western Spitsbergen, the Linné glacier (Linnébreen) advanced and retreated throughout the Holocene. Sediment from Linnébreen is deposited into Lake Linné, located 5 km downvalley. Sediment provenance in Linnédalen is being studied as part of the NSF-funded Svalbard REU Project to calibrate lamination stratigraphy in Lake Linné. This valley lends itself to provenance studies because it contains three distinct rock types: carbonate rocks form the eastern... Schiff 2005 Unsustainable Glacier Ablation at 78° N latitude, Linnébreen, Svalbard Dataset Abstract: Understanding the amount and timing of stream inflow to Linnevatnet is of critical importance when attempting to quantify sedimentation. Linnebreen, located 6km south of Linnevatnet, is the largest source for inflow to Linnevatnet. Mass balance measurements, via traditional stake methods, provide a tool to quantify Linnebreen’s contribution. Furthermore, mass balance studies shed light on the larger climatic regime of the area during the year of observation and provide a means to... Pratt 2005 Characterization and Calibration of Lamination Stratigraphy of Cores Recovered from Lake Linné, Svalbard Norway Dataset Abstract: The lamination stratigraphy of cores recovered from Lake Linné have been characterized and correlated to modern process data, instrumental weather records, and recent glacier mass balance data.

Project Collaborative Research: Assessing the Impact of Arctic Sea Ice Variability on the Greenland Ice Sheet Surface Mass and Energy Balance Metadata Principal Investigator: Julienne Stroeve CO Principal Investigator: Mark Serreze Description: The Arctic Ocean is rapidly losing its summer sea ice cover, leading to anomalous warming of the overlying atmosphere in autumn. Concurrent with this sea ice loss, the Greenland ice sheet has been losing mass recently, with increased surface melt and discharge rates. These changes are of great socioeconomic concern as continued negative trends in the extent of floating sea ice cover and ice sheet mass are likely to have widespread impacts on climate and global sea levels. The investigators propose that the simultaneous decreases in sea ice cover and increased melting of the Greenland ice sheet are connected. On the one hand, both may be largely responding to the same forcing to some degree, such as a generalized warming signal, amplified over the Arctic. On the other hand, it can be hypothesized that sea ice variability, through influences on mixed ocean layer temperatures, overlying air temperatures, column water vapor and atmospheric circulation, influences Greenland ice sheet surface melt and accumulation. Through a combination of data analysis, process studies and modeling, this project seeks to define the interactions between sea ice loss and Greenland ice sheet melt and accumulation. The following major research questions provide a framework for the study: 1) Does sea ice variability influence Greenland ice sheet surface melt (where, when, and how)? 2) What is the nature of storm activity around Greenland in the context of ice and ocean conditions and how might changes in the marine environment influence Greenland surface melt and accumulation in the future? This investigation will take advantage of up-to-date satellite sensor data, in combination with several new atmospheric reanalysis data products, station data and a state-of-the-art regional climate model, performed by a research team who are specialists in regional climate modeling, analysis of geospatial and sequential data analysis, satellite remote sensing and hydroclimatology in the Arctic and Greenland. This project will support students at the University of Colorado, the City College of New York and Rutgers University. The project also includes efforts to recruit undergraduates from underrepresented groups and will support a New Jersey high school teacher to develop lecture plans to be disseminated to a wide audience of K-12 educators at conferences and in journals.

Project Collaborative Research: The Polaris Project II: Amplifying the Impact Metadata Principal Investigator: Robert Max Holmes CO Principal Investigator: Sergei Zimov Paul Mann Susan Natali Resource Provider: Kathryn Heard Description: The Polaris Project II seeks to amplify the impact of Polaris I (now in its third and final year) through its extension, expansion, and enhancement. The three overarching objectives of Polaris II are to 1) train the next generation of arctic researchers, 2) advance scientific understanding of the Arctic, and 3) expand public awareness of the feedbacks between the Arctic and the global climate system. These objectives will be accomplished through a multi-faceted effort that includes a summer field course/research experience in the Siberian Arctic, a series of on-campus arctic-focused courses, and a wide range of outreach activities. While undergraduate students remain the primary focus of Polaris II, participation in the annual field course will be expanded to include a K-12 teacher, graduate student, postdoctoral researcher, and visiting faculty member each year. Outreach activities will target K-12 students and teachers, undergraduate students and faculty, and a diverse public audience. The unifying scientific theme of the Polaris Project is the transport and transformation of carbon and nutrients as they move with water from terrestrial uplands to the Arctic Ocean. Research conducted by the interdisciplinary Polaris Project team of faculty and students will make fundamental contributions to the scientific understanding of this topic, a central issue in arctic system science. While continued scientific advances are essential for arctic system understanding, prediction, and protection, tackling the climate change challenge is also a matter of education. Polaris II offers a unique experience in undergraduate research that will inspire and prepare a new generation of arctic researchers. Further, it will convey the importance of the Arctic to the public and to policy-makers, providing them with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions. The Polaris Project will achieve a broad and lasting impact by linking interdisciplinary scientific research to innovative undergraduate education and imaginative public outreach. In addition to providing a transformative experience for the participants in the annual Siberian field course, Polaris II will educate large numbers of undergraduate students who complete the Polaris-affiliated on-campus courses. The project will also engage K-12 students and teachers through direct and sustained interactions with Polaris PIs and broad dissemination of education and outreach materials. Finally, Polaris II will inform a diverse public audience about the state of the Arctic, ecosystems research, and global climate change. Approaches to project outreach include expansion of the Polaris website and associated blog (www.thepolarisproject.org) and the development of an online seminar series for undergraduates, K-12 teachers, and public participants. The production and wide distribution of multimedia videos addressing key arctic science themes will further expand the reach of the project, as will the inclusion of a writer in the 2011 field course with the objective of publishing a book about the Arctic, climate change, and the Polaris Project experience. As a resource for the scientific and education communities, Polaris data will be freely available through the project website and the Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (ACADIS).

Project Collaborative Research: Assessing the Impact of Small, Canadian Arctic River Flows (SCARFs) to the Freshwater Budget of the Canadian Archipelago Metadata Principal Investigator: Matthew Alkire Description: This three-year study proposes to characterize the geochemistry of the largely unstudied, remote rivers and estuaries in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA), with the ultimate aim of resolving the contribution of local freshwater inputs to CAA boundary currents. The investigators will target seven rivers for sampling. River sampling will occur during different flow regimes, but will emphasize sample collection during the spring freshet, the time of year when terrestrial runoff from local CAA rivers maximally impacts coastal waters. Estuarine sampling will include both horizontal and vertical profiles. The data will be synthesized and interpreted using mixing models and regression analyses, and compared with data for the Mackenzie and Yukon Rivers, which have historically been considered "typical" for North American runoff to the Arctic. Acceleration of glacial melt and the hydrologic cycle in a warmer world will likely increase local inputs of freshwater to the CAA. Because many such changes may already be underway, it is important to establish a baseline by which future changes can be compared. The proposed research has implications regarding the variability and magnitude of freshwater export from the Arctic and subarctic oceans to the North Atlantic, and the findings will help fill significant gaps in the knowledge of CAA river geochemistry and the Arctic freshwater cycle. The project will catalyze a new partnership among faculty, researchers, and students at the Applied Physics Laboratory and Northwestern University. Moreover, the research will include hands-on participation from local community members who will collect samples during various times of year to extend the temporal coverage of the study. Data will be made publicly available via websites and databases for maximum visibility, dispersion, and long-term archival. Additional activities include teaching and training of a postdoctoral student, incorporation of project findings into curricular materials, and outreach to K-12 students from traditionally underrepresented groups.

Project A Chronosequence Approach To Examine the Interaction of Fire and Permafrost Influence in Forest Regeneration and Carbon Sequestration in Far Northeastern Siberia Metadata Principal Investigator: Heather Alexander Description: Global change models predict high-latitude boreal forests will become increasingly susceptible to fire threat due to climate warming. Because boreal forests contain a large proportion of terrestrial carbon (C) stocks, any change to the fire regime will likely have substantial impacts on C exchange and storage. This project will utilize a chronosequence approach to examine how fire and permafrost interact to influence forest regeneration and C sequestration within larch forests near arctic treeline in Far Northeastern Siberia. The hypothesis is that post-fire soil organic layer depth mediates C storage through indirect impacts on forest regeneration because of its role as a thermal regulator and barrier to seed germination. This research will build on investigations initiated in summer 2010 and will be compared to recent and ongoing research within Interior Alaska. A cross-polar comparison will increase our understanding of how C dynamics under an altered fire regime vary across boreal regions with differing permafrost dynamics and vegetation types. This fellowship will support the post-doctoral fellow?s career goals by providing training in arctic boreal forest ecology, experience in executing independent research, skills in mentoring undergraduate students, and an opportunity to collaborate with arctic researchers from within and outside the U.S. By addressing fundamental questions concerning how an altered fire regime indirectly impacts C cycling of Siberian larch forests, this study will provide much needed information about an ecologically important yet understudied region and will improve our ability to predict the impacts of climate change and altered fire regimes on arctic ecosystems. Siberian larch forests comprise 20% of all boreal forest ecosystems and are a critical component of the global C cycle. They are different from other boreal forests in that they are comprised of a single tree genus (Larix spp.), with a deciduous growth habit, that often grows on continuous permafrost. Thus, their response to warming climate and an altered fire regime is likely to differ from boreal forests in other regions. Our current knowledge of their ecology and potential susceptibility to climate change remains limited because of logistical constraints associated with conducting research in Siberia and minimal translations of Russian scientific efforts into English. Uncertainties regarding current C pools in Siberian boreal forests remain a significant factor affecting our ability to predict climate-induced changes to the global C cycle. By comparing results to the relatively well-studied boreal forests of interior Alaska, the study will further our ability to detect whether boreal response to changing fire is similar across zones differing in permafrost characteristics and vegetation types, or whether more detailed studies are needed for accurate modeling of ecosystem response to climate change. The study will contribute to our understanding of how boreal fires impact global C cycling and provide essential data necessary for scaling-up boreal forest C pools, estimating C emissions from boreal fires, and calibrating predictive models of future global C cycling. Broader Impacts: The research will advance our understanding of Siberian larch forests, an important yet understudied ecosystem, while advancing the teaching and mentoring skills of a post- doctoral researcher. The post-doctoral fellow?s research activities, methodologies, and findings will be integrated into the education of undergraduate students through participation in the NSF-funded Polaris Project lecture series and discussion groups and by mentoring of an undergraduate field assistant in ecosystem ecology. Basing field research out of the Northeast Science Station in the Russian Far Northeast will provide a venue for building partnerships between the post-doctoral fellow, other arctic researchers from the U.S., and Russian collaborators. The collaborations will be used to integrate research findings with Russian scientific efforts. Scientific findings resulting from the proposed research will be widely disseminated through publications in scientific journals, presentations at international conferences, and more informally, through postings on the post-doctoral researcher?s web page. Active layer and soil moisture measurements will be submitted to the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring network to provide critical data for model validations and scaling-up of climate change impacts on boreal forest ecosystems.

Because fire consumes the soil organic layer (SOL), the layer of undecomposed mosses and roots atop the permafrost, we hypothesized that increased fire severity will increase permafrost thaw by reducing the depth, and therefore insulating capacity, of the SOL. To test this hypothesis, we conducted plot-level (2-m2) experimental burns in July 2012 in a low-density, mature larch...

Project A Modular Approach to Building an Arctic Observing System for the IPY and Beyond in the Switchyard Region of the Arctic Ocean Metadata Principal Investigator: Peter Schlosser Collaborating Principal Investigator: Ronald Kwok Michael Steele CO Principal Investigator: William Smethie Jr. Dale Chayes Description: This collaboration consists of 0633878 (Schlosser, Columbia University, LEAD), 0633885 (Steele, University of Washington) and 0633343 (Kwok, NASA). In this continuation of the Switchyard project (Steele/Schlosser/Kwok, 0230427), researchers will establish a long-term Arctic Ocean observing system component in the switchyard region of the Arctic Ocean north of Greenland and Ellesmere Island, Canada. The project will continue and expand two aircraft-based hydrographic surveys between Alert and the North Pole for long-term observation. The Columbia University team will use a Twin Otter aircraft to measure hydrographic properties and a set of tracers aimed at resolving relative age structure (CFC s, tritium/3He) and freshwater components (18O and Ba) in the upper water column utilizing the Arctic CTD/rosette system on a section between Ellesmere Island and the North Pole. This modular system is deployed through a 12 hole drilled through the sea ice and traces T, S, and DO, while at the same time allowing the collection of up to 12 water samples. The University of Washington team led by M. Steele will measure hydrographic properties in the Lincoln Sea, up to 500 km away from shore, using helicopters and Twin Otter aircraft to capture the structure and transport of the water masses coming around the Canadian Basin on their way to Nares and Fram straits. To complete the quantitative assessment of the transport of the water masses from the Canadian Basin towards Nares Strait and Fram Strait, a University of Washington team led by C. Lee will deploy lightweight moorings across the shelf just west of Nares Strait to separate the individual transports through these straits. In situ observations will be augmented by R. Kwok from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), who will examine satellite-derived observations of the sea ice motion and mass budget.

Project A Prototype Network for Measuring Arctic Winter Precipitation and Snow Cover (SnowNet 1 and 2) Metadata Principal Investigator: Matthew Sturm Collaborating Principal Investigator: Glen Liston Douglas Kane Description: The grant, a collaboration between 0632131 (Sturm, CRREL, LEAD), 0632160 (Kane, UAF) and 0632133 (Liston, CSU). The chief goal is working to develop better instruments and ways of measuring snow in the Arctic, and analyzing the resultant data. At sites at Barrow, Imnavait Creek, and Fox, Alaska, and in Inuvik, Canada the team has installed meteorological and snow measuring instrumentation including solid-state snow pillows, heated plate precipitation sensors, snow fences (to capture the wind-blown flux), and normal and eddy correlation meteorological towers for monitoring snowfall and snow on the ground. In addition to these autonomous instruments, the team periodically runs intense field campaigns during which a variety snow surveys are conducted, including surveys of snow cover depth, snow water equivalent, density, stratigraphy and other properties. These ground-based surveys are being augmented using aerial photography and ground- and airborne LiDAR. Part of the project is also focused on developing new types of sensors and techniques, including the development of small, low-cost sonic sounders for depth, rotating sonic sounders for better averages of depth, and airborne and ground-based light detection and ranging (LiDAR) for extensive snow depth and surface topography. The combined suite of instrument development and measurement protocols is designed to allow closure of the winter water balance and lead to better ways of monitoring Arctic snow for climate. Within the U.S., this improvement in monitoring would directly benefit the National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), one of the prime agencies charged with monitoring precipitation and snow cover, as well as the U.S. Weather Service. In addition, the project is contributing to the education of several graduate students, and has had positive impact on the general public through the publication of an English-Inupiat glossary as well as two other books and several papers on the Arctic. The project data on ACADIS have been separated into time series data as reported from the autonomous instruments like weather stations and webcams, and intermittent data from field campaigns collected by humans. These latter appear by campaign date. Because the data come from four (4) different Arctic locations, and at each location have been obtained from a spatial extent that ranges from a few to hundreds of kilometers, a data user is advised to contact the Project Leader (Dr. M. Sturm, matthew.sturm@usace.army.mil) for specific metadata information.

Project A Replacement Laser for the Arctic High Spectral Resolution Lidar Metadata Principal Investigator: Edwin Eloranta Description: This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). This award supports the purchase of a new laser to replace the current laser in the lidar at Eureka, Nunavut, Canada. The installation of the new laser will improve instrument reliability and data quality of an observing system that has been operating as part of the Arctic Observing Network since July 2005. The "Intellectual Merit" of this project is that the Eureka lidar data are providing much needed information on the occurrence and microphysics of arctic clouds and aerosols. Such data are needed to reduce uncertainty in computer model representation of clouds and to improve predictions of the rate of Arctic warming. The "Broader Impacts" of this project include the availability of the data via an innovative Web site (http://lidar.ssec.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/processeddata/retrievedata.cgi?site=3) where customized data products can be ordered. In addition, 3-minute averages of backscatter cross-section and depolarization will be archived for the long-term at the Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (CADIS). The lidar is co-located with a suite of other atmospheric sounding instruments that are contributing to IASOA (International Arctic Systems for Observing the Atmosphere). Continued acquisition of the lidar data will be a valuable contribution to the Observing Change component of SEARCH (Study of Arctic Environmental Change).

Project Accessing the potential of clumped isotope thermometry to constrain temperatures in the Arctic during the Pliocene Metadata Principal Investigator: Aradhna Tripati Description: The specific goal of this research is to identify whether carbonate "clumped isotope" thermometry can be applied to mollusks to accurately and precisely reconstruct temperatures in the Arctic. Previous work has shown that the occurrence of multiple rare isotope substitutions in carbonate minerals, also referred to as the "clumping" of heavy isotopes into bonds with each other, is temperature dependent. This temperature proxy is also independent of the del-18O of water and the del-13C of dissolved inorganic carbon. Initial studies of biologically-precipitated calcite and aragonite by the PI and co-PI and collaborators indicate that the measurements of 13C-18O bond abundance should allow one to make a relatively assumption-free determination of the temperature at which a mineral formed. Although this new proxy looks promising, calibration of the clumped isotope thermometer at low temperatures (i.e., below 15C) is limited. Therefore the utility of this proxy for climate reconstructions in the Arctic is unclear. This project will determine the accuracy and precision of the technique when applied to biological samples grown at Arctic temperatures and, consequently, the ability of this technique to assess paleo ocean temperatures in polar regions. The instrumental record of temperature only goes back in time a few hundred years, at most. In order to understand the natural variability of temperature, either locally or globally, we require much longer records. To develop such records, we rely on proxy measurements for temperature. Use of such proxies requires assumptions and often imposes large error bars on the estimated temperature. This project will determine the usefulness of a new proxy in the polar regions. This research is an Early-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) proposal.

Project Adaptive long-term fasting in land and ice-bound polar bears: Coping with ice loss in the Arctic Metadata Principal Investigator: Henry Harlow CO Principal Investigator: Merav Ben-David Description: The population biology of polar bears occupying land in summer months is comparatively well known. Much less is known about the larger fraction of polar bear populations which stays on the ice through the summer. A better understanding of the physiology of fasting in both summer habitats is needed to understand how reduced sea ice cover in the Arctic will impact polar bear populations. Bears that stay ashore in summer have almost no access to food and tend to be inactive. Those that stay on the ice, however, have continued access to prey and make extensive movements. This project pairs scientists from the University of Wyoming and the U. S. Geological Service to follow the movements of bears in both habitats and monitor their body temperature, muscle condition, blood chemistry, and metabolism. They will determine the physiological implications of summering on the ice versus on shore. The physiological data will be added to spatially-explicit individual-based population models to predict population response to reduced ice cover. The results will provide information important to management by indigenous, U.S., and international management and conservation agencies and address the interests of policy makers and the public.

Project Aerial Hydrographic Surveys for IPY and Beyond: Tracking Change and Understanding Seasonal Variability Metadata Principal Investigator: James Morison Collaborating Principal Investigator: Kelly Falkner Andrey Proshutinsky Robert Collier Miles McPhee Christopher Guay CO Principal Investigator: Andreas Heiberg Michael Steele Description: This collaborative project is composed of the following: 0634226 (Morison, UW, LEAD), 0634122 (Collier, Oregon State), 0634097 (McPhee, McPhee Research Company), 0633979 (Proshutinsky, Woods Hole) and 0634167 (Guay, Pacific Marine Sciences and Technology). The investigators propose to take annual springtime, large-scale airborne surveys of the Arctic Ocean. These surveys will be in two regions: the central Arctic Ocean (annual surveys), and the southern Beaufort Sea (biannual surveys). They will thus sample the two main circulation features of the Arctic Ocean, the Transpolar Drift Stream and the Beaufort Gyre. In both cases, the researchers will leverage existing operational capabilities when possible, such as the North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) in the central Arctic and US Navy Ice Camps in the Beaufort Sea. The total number of stations will reach a maximum of about 25 at each location during International Polar Year (IPY), decreasing to a lower level after IPY as part of a long-term Arctic Observing Network (AON). The proposed surveys have two main goals: (a) observe Arctic Ocean change by taking sea ice and ocean sections across frontal features, and (b) advance the understanding of seasonal variability in the sea ice - upper ocean system to map the growth and melt of ice and to reduce seasonal bias in comparisons of past and future hydrographic records. The field team will complete up to five meridional sections during IPY from the North Pole south to 85N, with possible extensions. Pairs of sections will be done annually after IPY. In the Beaufort Sea, they will complete two meridional sections extending to 78N and two nearly zonal sections that will pre-sample summertime icebreaker cruise tracks. After IPY, the researchers will do a subset of sections biannually. To resolve seasonal change, station locations will be chosen to provide winters-end comparisons with summers-end measurements made by Ice Tethered Platforms (ITPs) and icebreakers. At each station, researchers will collect a variety of physical and chemical ocean data, including temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen using proven methods. They will expand the high-resolution chemical profiling through inclusion of a new nitrate sensing system. The researchers will also take bottle samples of tracers such as dissolved oxygen, barium, phosphate, silicate, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, alkalinity, and oxygen isotopes. In collaboration with US and European sea-ice scientists, project scientists will acquire snow and sea ice thickness data both along the flight tracks using remote sensing and in situ observations while on station. In collaboration with US, European, and Canadian scientists, the researchers will extend their section data from the central Arctic toward the coastlines. This project, together with information from the ITPs, will give the most comprehensive, synoptic view of springtime, Arctic Ocean sea ice - ocean conditions since the Soviet airborne survey programs in the 1970s. Information from the project will effectively track Arctic Ocean change, and with corresponding summer measurements, will provide seasonal coverage with which to test system models and their ability to capture system variability. Two graduate students will receive hands-on training via this project and the public will be engaged in polar discovery through a range of activities including public lectures, K-12 presentations and various IPY activities.

Project An Innovative Observational Network for Critical Arctic Gateways--Understanding Exchanges through Davis and Fram Straits Metadata Principal Investigator: Craig Lee Description: This coordinated international effort plans to quantify the variability of fluxes connecting the Arctic and subpolar oceans, understand the role played by the Arctic and sub-Arctic in steering decadal scale climate variability and establish a pan-Arctic integrated observing network. Researcher's investigation will focus on understanding exchanges across a major gateway linking the Arctic with the subpolar North Atlantic Davis Strait (Canadian Arctic Archipelago). Fluxes through Davis Strait represent the net integrated Canadian Archipelago throughflow, modified by terrestrial inputs and oceanic processes during its southward transit through Baffin Bay. By the time they reach Davis Strait, Arctic waters already embody most of the transformations they undergo prior to exerting their influence on the deepwater formation sites in the Labrador Sea. This project will study the Davis Strait watermass variability, volume, liquid freshwater, heat and ice fluxes at weekly to inter-annual timescales. These measurements will be used to advance understanding of the impacts of these exchanges on large scale characteristics of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.

Project An Ocean Observing System for the Bering Strait, the Pacific Gateway to the Arctic Metadata Principal Investigator: Rebecca Woodgate Collaborating Principal Investigator: Tom Weingartner Description: Given the significant role of Pacific waters in the Arctic, quantifying the Bering Strait throughflow and its properties is important to understanding the present functioning of the Arctic system, as well as the causes and prediction of present and future Arctic change. This makes a Bering Strait monitoring system a vital component of the Arctic Observing Network (AON). Thus, this proposal is for an international project to: 1) measure the velocities and water properties of the Bering Strait throughflow, and quantify oceanic fluxes of volume, freshwater, heat and nutrients through the strait; 2) design (and calibrate) an optimum monitoring system for oceanic fluxes through the Bering Strait on daily to interannual time scales, using in situ, satellite, and numerical weather prediction results; and 3) utilize the system design to improve and extend previous Bering Strait flux estimates back several decades and provide uncertainty estimates for all fluxes.

Project An open source framework for metadata exploration and discovery of Polar Data Metadata Principal Investigator: Chris Mattmann Description: This project will deliver an open source framework for metadata exploration, automatic text mining and information retrieval of polar data that uses the Apache Tika technology. Apache Tika is currently the de facto "babel fish", aiding in the automatic MIME detection, text extraction, and metadata classification of over 1200 data formats. The PI will expand Tika to handle polar data and scientific data formats, making Polar data more easily available, searchable, and retrievable by all major content management systems. The proposed activity will lay the framework for a thorough automatically generated inventory of polar metadata and data. Expanding Tika to handle polar data will also naturally invite the technology/open source community to deal with polar use cases, helping to increase understanding of the arctic. The resultant software produced through effort will be disseminated to the software and polar communities through the Apache Software Foundation. A computer science graduate student and postdoc will be exposed to Cryosphere and Arctic data, helping to train the next generation of cross disciplinary data scientists in the domain. The PI's Search Engines (20-40 students annual enrollment) and Software Architecture (30-50 students annual enrollment) graduate courses at USC will benefit from the Arctic cyberinfrastructure use cases disseminated through course projects and lecture material. The PI will also work collaboratively with NSF-funded projects dealing with projects focusing on the archiving, discovery and access of polar data, such as ACADIS and the Antarctic Master Directory. *Note: the bounding box for this project reflects where the software was created.

Project Annual Observations of the Biological and Physical Marine Environment in the Chukchi and Nearshore Beaufort Seas near Barrow, AK Metadata Principal Investigator: Carin Ashjian Collaborating Principal Investigator: Robert Campbell Stephen Okkonen Description: The Arctic Ocean ecosystem may respond dramatically to climate change through already observed modification of the physical environment (e.g., hydrography and ice cover). A better understanding of the coupled biological-physical ocean ecosystem, and its interannual variability, is necessary to predict and understand these potential impacts of climate change on the Arctic ecosystem. The Chukchi-Beaufort Sea region near Barrow, AK, including coastal waters, has been identified as key because it lies at the junction of several ocean regions and downstream of the Pacific Arctic gateway and hence is influenced physically and ecologically by input from Bering Strait. Researchers have conducted oceanographic sampling of the coupled physical and biological marine environment in the Chukchi and near-shore Beaufort Seas for five years (2005 - 2009), including coastal waters, using boat-based surveys during late summer and short-term (month) and year-long bottom-mounted moorings, and have observed significant interannual variability. They will now establish annual surveys of the pelagic marine environment and deploy a year-round mooring in Barrow Canyon as components of the Arctic Observing Network (AON). The surveys will measure a range of biological and physical parameters including hydrography, currents, plankton standing stocks, nutrients, and plankton genetics. The mooring will measure ocean currents, near bottom temperature and salinity, and acoustic backscatter (zooplankton proxy) in Barrow Canyon at a location typically within or beneath the Alaska Coastal Current. Results from this AON component will provide a 10-year record and enable a better understanding of inter-annual variability in the physical and biological characteristics of the Barrow area ocean confluence. Based on these data, changes in biological characteristics that respond to larger climate change can be detected. This proposed AON component includes measurements of key oceanic biological and chemical parameters, and their coupling to physical parameters from a region sensitive to climate change. The researchers will actively communicate plans and results with the community of Barrow through formal and informal discussions and presentations. They will also support the participation of a teacher in fieldwork for two of the years.

Project Arctic Great Rivers Observatory Metadata Principal Investigator: Bruce Peterson Description: The river linkage between the land and the Arctic Ocean plays a central role in the rapidly evolving dynamics of the Arctic System. Six great rivers provide the majority of the continental fresh water to the Arctic Ocean, the most landlocked and freshwater-dominated of the Earth's seas. By measuring the flux of water and constituents at the junction between the continents and the ocean in these key rivers, it is possible to efficiently assess changes occurring across vast regions of the continents that may diagnose environmental change on land and forecast imminent changes in circulation and biogeochemical processes in the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans. We propose an Arctic Great Rivers Observatory (Arctic-GRO) project that will assess river constituent fluxes in the Ob, Yenisey, Lena, Kolyma, Yukon, and Mackenzie Rivers. These observations will be used to test hypotheses about the magnitude, controls and ecological significance of these fluxes and will provide new information on inter-annual variability and on trends in the major fluxes of constituents to the Arctic Ocean.

Project Arctic Ocean Acidification: Bering Strait Time Series Metadata Principal Investigator: Fredrick Prahl CO Principal Investigator: Burke Hales Resource Provider: Kelly Falkner Description: This project, part of the Arctic Observing Network, will collect two years of in situ data pertaining to ocean acidification from an existing mooring in Bering Strait. Oceanic uptake of CO2 lowers pH and changes speciation of several key chemical constituents of seawater with important consequences for the physiology of organisms and transmission of sound in seawater. Global coupled climate models that take into account rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere predict that the Arctic Ocean will be the first and most strongly impacted of the world?s oceans by acidification. High quality observations in key Arctic Ocean locations are needed for both the global and regional modeling communities to test and improve their predictive capabilities. Instruments for the project include indicator based (SAMI) pCO2 and pH sensors as well as a solid state IS-FET pH sensor with dissolved oxygen optode and conductivity sensors. Calibration will be achieved through a hydrographic measurement and sampling program for pCO2, DIC, alkalinity and O2 conducted in conjunction with all deployment and recoveries. This will be the first extended co-deployment of indicator and solid-state pH sensors in the oceans and thus the first comparison of their performance under realistic field conditions. Such information is needed to more fully characterize the solid-state systems whose lower power requirements are desirable for extended glider, float and mooring deployment. Insights from comparative exercises such as this will inform the design of the Arctic Observing Network and an eventual global ocean acidification observation network. The PIs will address ocean acidification in a range of their on-going educational and informal outreach activities. They will also leverage the Teacher-At-Sea program for the existing Arctic Observing Network-Bering Strait project by soliciting participation by Oregon classrooms. Undergraduates in the OSU honors program will be exposed to this emerging real world problem and gain training through entrainment in the laboratory components of the project. Data will be deposited with the Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (ACADIS).

Project Arctic Ocean redox history and Hg cycling using redox-sensitive trace metals and Hg isotopes: the influence of sea ice Metadata Principal Investigator: Jamie Gleason Description: The investigators will measure mercury (Hg) concentrations, mercury isotopes, and a suite of trace metals in previously-collected Arctic sediment cores in order to increase understanding of paleoceanographic conditions in the Arctic Ocean as well as overall understanding of mercury cycling, particularly prior to the interference of humans with the mercury cycle. The abundance and isotopic composition of mercury in Arctic sediments may be sensitive to (and thus record changes in) such processes as sea ice cover, biological productivity, and changing sources of mercury. Questions that can be addressed over the course of this research include: 1)What is the Hg isotopic composition of the Pleistocene-Holocene Arctic Ocean? 2)Can Hg isotopes be used to infer different Hg sources to the Arctic Ocean? 3)Can Hg isotopes be used to quantify extent of sea ice growth and retreat in the Pleistocene-Holocene Arctic? That is, can Hg isotopes by used as a proxy for sea ice? 4)Is the Hg isotopic system sensitive to changes in organic productivity during shifts in Arctic climate and ice volume? 5)Can Hg isotopic investigations of the ancient record help predict changes in the Hg cycle during an ice-free (summer) Arctic environment of the future? 6)Can knowledge gained by studying Hg isotopes in the unique environment of the Arctic be applied globally to ocean productivity and circulation studies? This work has potential impacts in understanding the geochemical cycling of mercury, an important neurotoxin. It also promises to improve our ability to decipher Arctic paleoclimate. One graduate student and three undergraduate research interns would be supported by the proposed research.

Project Autonomous Ice Mass Balance Buoys for an Arctic Observing Network Metadata Principal Investigator: Jacqueline Richter-Menge Description: Please find the near real time data available at http://imb.crrel.usace.army.mil/ This award supports the deployment of ice mass balance (IMB) buoys as part of the Arctic Observing Network (AON) and the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH). The autonomous, ice-based drifting buoys measure, delineate and, importantly, attribute thermodynamically-driven changes in the thickness of the ice cover. The IMBs will be deployed strategically and in coordination with other elements of AON to optimize the observation of changes and trends in sea ice throughout the Arctic Basin. The Broader Impacts of this award are many. IMB data have and will continue to assist large-scale modeling efforts to improve the treatment of ice growth and decay in GCMs and to assess the relative impact of ice thermodynamics on the observed changes in the Arctic sea ice cover. Results will also provide baseline data to support the development of instruments and algorithms to remotely sense snow depth, ice thickness, and the onset of freeze-up. More generally, this work presents an extraordinary opportunity to capture the attention and imagination of the public and of schoolchildren. The centerpiece of active commitment to educational outreach will be the design and implementation of the Adopt-a-Buoy program, where K-12 students will have the opportunity to name and follow a designated buoy after it is deployed in the Arctic. Our participation in a recently funded Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship Program (IGERT), Polar Environmental Change with Dartmouth College, will facilitate the involvement of graduate students.

Project Bering Sea Sub-Network: International Community-Based Observation Alliance for Arctic Observing Network (BSSN) Metadata Principal Investigator: Victoria Gofman Description: Indigenous peoples around the economically important Bering Sea region are launching a project that will monitor environmental changes in the region. The project will involve Native organizations in western Alaska and in the Russian northeast. The Bering Sea, one of the most productive seas in the world, which includes globally important habitats for many biological resources, is now undergoing far-reaching environmental changes including climate change that alarm scientists, coastal residents and others from around the world. The region is of vital economic importance to both the US and Russia. The health, economic well-being, and ways of life of indigenous and non-indigenous peoples in the region are connected to the Bering Sea and its natural resources. The socioeconomic development of coastal villages along the Bering Sea, on both the Russian and United States sides, is dependent on maintaining ecologically sustainable conditions in the region. This monitoring project is critical to the future of the region and of the peoples who live there, says Michael Zacharof, the president of the Aleut International Association, which is leading the project. People in our communities notice even the slightest changes in nature but they do not have resources and tools to document them properly and to conduct research. In the Native communities, there are no field seasons . We are in the field all year around and we think it is necessary to bring research, monitoring and observation capabilities to the local communities. By involving the people who live there, we can do this cost-effectively. The Bering Sea Sub-Network: International Community-Based Environmental Observation Alliance for Arctic Observing Network (BSSN), endorsed by International Polar Year (IPY) Joint Committee, will involve six local indigenous communities, three each in the U.S. and Russia, to monitor and share the changes they observe. Changes could include the shift of southern species north, changes in distribution and abundance of fish and other temperature-sensitive species, changes in ice patterns, and weather observations. Observations will be collected using surveying methods across the network based on standard protocols. BSSN will address the questions of: 1) historical and present distribution and properties of economic and subsistence important species as derived from collective indigenous and traditional knowledge; 2) types of major variables and indicators that could be correlated with western science to develop predictable models based on indigenous and traditional knowledge; and 3) spatial and temporal convergence and divergence of community-derived and western science data. This project will assess large scale environmental changes in the Arctic by looking at both the physical and human dimensions of change and its impact. Success of this project will leave a legacy not only for IPY but also for a broad community of arctic residents striving to organize an observing system that is a valid partner in pan-arctic observations.

Project Bering Sea Sub Network: A Distributed Human Sensor Array to Detect Arctic Environmental Change Metadata Principal Investigator: Victoria Gofman Lilian Alessa CO Principal Investigator: Patricia Cochran Andrew Kliskey Description: This award will support the continued implementation of the Bering Sea Sub-Network (BSSN), a regional initiative of community-based organizations in Western Alaska and Northeast Russia. The "Intellectual Merit" of BSSN lies in its operation as a distributed network which employs people as individual, coordinated sensors for local environmental observations of socio-ecological change. BSSN will address the following questions: (1) how have economically significant species changed over the past century and what strategies have residents used to cope with these changes; (2) what key biophysical variables and indicators may be correlated to changes in distribution and properties of ecologically significant species; (3) how well do indigenous and traditional knowledge and Western science show spatial/temporal convergence and statistical correlation at local and regional scales; and (4) what are the major trends, patterns and constraints in individual and community adaptation to changes? The "Broader Impacts" of this award include a better understanding of Arctic environmental system change and resilience, and how to develop appropriate adaptation strategies to change for Arctic communities. BSSN will leave a legacy for a broad community of arctic residents striving to organize an observing system that is a valid partner in pan-Arctic environmental system observations. A key product will be a widely disseminated and highly accessible publication entitled The State of the Bering Sea Bioresources: Perspectives of Local Residents, an assessment based on observations of local and indigenous observers. Other products will include a tool kit for communities to develop their own observing programs based on the framework of BSSN, and an annual illustrated magazine aimed at the village and regional levels.

However, observed changes have yet to be linked to below ground processes of past ecosystem productivity and specifically how natural variations in moisture and temperature during the Holocene influenced microbial processing of soil organic matter. This project is to explore the relationship between chemical composition and bioavailability of Arctic soil carbon accumulated since the early Holocene. The project will result in a potentially transformative parameterization of the drivers of Arctic soil carbon usage that may be applicable globally. This research is directly related to understanding processes affecting Arctic soil carbon and will support an early career researcher. This study will provide training opportunities for a graduate student (Ph.D. student in Earth Sciences at the University of South Carolina) and several undergraduate students, who will be trained through existing summer research programs (NSF funded REU in Marine Biogeochemistry at USC). Strategies for outreach and information dissemination include: 1) recruitment of minority undergraduate to participate in summer research and present their findings, 2) inclusion of the Holocene climate data in upper level undergraduate and graduate courses, 3) creation of a project website to highlight the main findings of the project, 4) working with journalists to share the research on an internationally distributed Podcast, and 5) communicating the findings with other scientists through publishing in top-tier journals and through presentations at national or international meetings. Capitalizing on the premise that microbial cell membranes adopt the radiocarbon signature of their food sources, this work will fingerprint in situ carbon usage as a function of soil chemical polarity, contemporary moisture conditions and Holocene climate variability in a range of soils from the Arctic Circle to the Canadian high Arctic. The working hypothesis is that soil carbon bioavailability is strongly influenced by the chemical polarity of organic matter. It is expected that moist conditions favor both the production of more chemically polar compounds and increased microbial reworking of organic matter, such that variations in Arctic Holocene moisture are coupled to soil carbon bioavailability. Establishing a relationship between the soil chemistry and bioavailability will enable more accurate representation of soil carbon in Earth System models, which is especially critical in the Arctic.

Project Biomass Burning, Dust, Sea Salt, Volcanic and Pollution Aerosols in the Arctic during the Last 2 Millennia: High Resolution Aerosol Records from NEEM and an Aray of Archived Ice Cores Metadata Principal Investigator: Joseph McConnell Description: This award will support the development and interpretation of a new generation of records of short-lived aerosols from biomass burning, dust, sea spray, volcanism, and industrial pollution in the Arctic during the past 2000 years and for selected time periods during the past >130,000 years. These objectives will be accomplished using a unique, NSF-funded analytical system developed specifically for such measurements in ice cores and recently expanded to include detailed measurements of black carbon (BC; soot) and a range of new aerosol source tracers. Proposed measurements of aerosols during the past 2000 years - building on a series of recently published findings from similar measurements in shallower ice cores - will be made on samples from a 400 m shallow core collected by Danish collaborators in 2008 and 2009 at the NorthEem (NEEM) drilling site in northern Greenland. To place the NEEM measurements in larger Arctic and global perspective, samples from a broad array of ~1000 year archived Arctic ice cores also will be analyzed and results from the Arctic measurements compared with similar century to millennial scale aerosol measurements already underway in Antarctic ice cores. Intellectual Merit: Natural changes in the Earth's climate are well documented in paleoclimate records, but the climate history provided by deep ice cores needs to be complemented by better understanding of how recent climate changes have affected different regions and relationships among high-, mid-, and lowlatitude processes. Short-lived aerosols - including those generated by wildfires - are important environmental and global climate forcing agents and, because of the snow-albedo feedback, particularly important to Arctic forcing when deposited in snow and ice. Their sources are primarily in the low- and mid-latitudes, but their impacts on the Polar Regions - poorly quantified because of the paucity of reliable, long-term measurements - are profound. The rich glaciochemical records developed from the NEEM and archived ice cores, especially when compared to similar Antarctic ice core aerosol records and the results synthesized through collaborative modeling studies, will transform global understanding of the sources and histories of short-lived BC, dust, volcanic, sea salt, and pollution aerosols and their impacts on climate forcing, ecosystems, and human health. Moreover, because wildfire emissions are one factor directly modulating GHG concentrations, the independent history of fire emissions provided by this and related Antarctic research will contribute to a quantitative interpretation of changing GHG concentrations measured in the deep NEEM and WAIS Divide ice cores. Broader Impacts: Policy decisions are guided by global climate model (GCM) predictions of climate under different scenarios of societal behavior; climate predictions are critically dependent on well-tuned, validated models. Despite large uncertainties in aerosol forcing identified by the IPCC, ice core aerosol records seldom are used in GCM calibration, parameterization, or tuning because of the limited scope and reliability of past ice core aerosol measurements. New generation aerosol measurements from this ice core analytical system are suitable and have enabled recent collaborations with the GCM community. To ensure the broadest impact of the proposed research in climate change and policy arenas (e.g., recent testimony before the U.S. Congress on short-lived pollutants and Arctic climate change), ongoing collaborations with modelers at NCAR, NOAA/GFDL and NASA/GISS will be expanded to incorporate the proposed ice core measurements into GCM studies. This proposal also directly addresses a thrust of the NSF-sponsored International Partnerships in Ice Core Sciences (IPICS) initiative - development of an array of detailed ice core records spanning the last 2000 years aimed at better understanding long-term climate records thorough improved, quantitative investigation of recent climate change and the role of human activities in climate forcing and on the environment. The NEEM project provides many national and international opportunities for education and outreach. The proposed effort will leverage these opportunities to the fullest extent and continue the long-term record of high school, undergraduate and graduate student, and post-doctoral fellow involvement in the laboratory; K-12 educational efforts; and dissemination of results through high visibility publications and outreach to the public, popular media, and policy makers.

Project Canopy gas exchange and growth of white spruce near the Arctic treeline: confronting measurements with models along natural and experimental resource gradients Metadata Principal Investigator: Patrick Sullivan CO Principal Investigator: Bjartmar Sveinbjörnsson Description: The position of the arctic treeline has important implications for surface energy budgets and carbon cycling in a changing climate. Modeling efforts suggest these effects are relevant on regional and global scales. Our understanding of the controls on tree growth at the arctic treeline has been developed using tree ring studies, which are necessarily correlative and not mechanistic in nature. These tree ring studies have identified both positive and negative radial growth responses to warming in the later half of the 20th century. Investigators have speculated that negative growth trends reflect an increasing importance of temperature-induced drought stress and that treeline advance may be expected in mesic and wet areas, but not in dry areas, with future climate warming. Recent work has revealed several important complexities that clearly show we have oversimplified the relationships between climate and tree growth at the arctic treeline. Detailed measurements of seasonal changes in tree physiology and growth in response to changes in resource availability are now required to take our understanding to the next level. This work will coordinate continuous measurements of white spruce canopy gas exchange with weekly measurements of branch gas exchange and leader, branch, radial and fine root growth in trees receiving factorial nutrient and water supplements along a gradient of parent material depth. Results of the study will, for the first time: resolve the seasonality of C uptake and water loss in treeline white spruce; compare the seasonality and magnitudes of growth in all major organs; articulate the consequences of changes in resource availability for white spruce gas exchange physiology and growth along a gradient where resource availability varies naturally; and identify a process-based model that accurately describes the relationships between climate and tree growth at the arctic treeline.

Project Carbon, Water, and Energy Balance of the Arctic Landscape at Flagship Observatories and in a Pan-Arctic Network Metadata Principal Investigator: Gaius Shaver Collaborating Principal Investigator: Syndonia Bret-Harte CO Principal Investigator: Edward Rastetter John Hobbie Description: This grant is a collaboration with 0632264 (Bret-Harte, UAF). The research will (1) establish observatories at two existing sites of research on landscape-level carbon, water, and energy balance at Toolik Lake (Alaska) and Cherskiy (Siberia) and (2) forms a network of observatories across the Arctic where similar long-term observations of carbon, water and energy variables are made or proposed as part of International Polar Year (IPY). These collaborating sites are Toolik, Cherskiy, Abisko (Sweden, the main site of the ABACUS project), Zackenberg (Greenland), and several sites in Arctic Canada. This four-year grant funds instruments and personnel at Toolik and Cherskiy as well as international workshops and visits among the five sites that would ensure that data and instrumentation are easily comparable. Rather than studying one process at a time, this project focuses on simultaneous measurements of carbon, water, and energy fluxes of the Arctic terrestrial landscape at hourly, daily, seasonal, and multiyear time scales. These are major regulatory drivers of the Arctic System, forming key linkages and feedbacks between the land surface, the atmosphere, and the oceans. Observations and interpretation of carbon, water, and surface energy exchanges will be based on carbon dioxide and methane flux and micrometeorological tower measurements, as well as measurements of plant growth, stream flow, and carbon in flowing water (dissolved organic and inorganic carbon).

Project Chemical Weathering and Organic Carbon Export from Arctic Watersheds, North Slope, Alaska Metadata Principal Investigator: Andrew Jacobson Description: Recent climate change has dramatically impacted the Arctic, and models suggest that accelerated effects will occur in the future as CO2 continues to accumulate in the atmosphere. Understanding this problem is important because arctic environmental change could have planetary-scale repercussions within human timescales. In particular, oxidation of organic carbon stored in permafrost might create a positive feedback to global warming. While numerous studies have focused on the relationship between warming and carbon cycling in the Arctic, specific effects of rising atmospheric CO2 levels on chemical weathering processes and coupled changes in organic carbon dynamics have received relatively little attention. This project has two integrated goals: to identify mineral weathering reactions and hydrologic processes that control how and at what rate the inorganic solute geochemistry of water evolves during transport within soils and streams and to establish linkages between chemical weathering phenomena and organic carbon export. The work will focus on the major ion and isotope geochemistry of headwater streams and creeks draining the North Slope of Alaska. Based on preliminary data, the guiding hypothesis of the work is that the ratio of carbonate to silicate weathering fluctuates in response to seasonal changes in discharge and permafrost active layer depth, with the highest ratios observed during base flow conditions and maximum active layer depth and the lowest ratios observed during peak flow conditions and minimum active layer depth. To test this hypothesis and its implications for understanding organic carbon export, the team will: 1) Quantify rates of major cation release, CO2 consumption, and dissolved organic carbon (DIC) production by carbonate and silicate weathering; 2) Evaluate controls on the Ca, Sr, and C (of DIC) isotope composition of rivers and soils; and 3) Establish relationships between these tracers and other river water constituents, including H and O isotopes of water, organic matter concentrations, and the isotope composition of organic matter (both C and N). They will collect water, sediment, bedrock, and soil samples. Water sampling will occur from spring thaw through fall freeze-up. In the laboratory, they will conduct leaching and digestion experiments to quantify mineral weathering end members. They will synthesize data using mass-balance modeling, carbonate equilibria calculations, hydrograph separations, and elemental and isotope mixing equations. This study represents one of the first integrative efforts to elucidate fundamental linkages between the isotope and organic geochemistry of Arctic Alaskan rivers. Because warming will likely alter the ratio of carbonate to silicate weathering via several feedback mechanisms, this study will establish a novel method for monitoring Arctic environmental change at the watershed scale.

Project Chromophoric dissolved organic material (CDOM) in Arctic surface waters, implications for solar heating Metadata Principal Investigator: Victoria Hill Description: CDOM has been identified as a major factor in the absorption of solar energy into Arctic surface waters, controlling the vertical partitioning of solar energy and directly impacting the degree of solar heating, ice melt and thermal stratification. The source of this material on Western Arctic shelf seas is ambiguous. A positive correlation between CDOM absorption and salinity argues against a terrestrial source. High concentrations observed within sea ice cores point towards this medium as a potentially important substrate for production and storage of marine derived CDOM. Projected sea ice retreat will eliminate this CDOM pool, reducing the influx of optically active material to surface waters during the critical ice-melting phase. Warming on land could result in an increased flux of terrestrial CDOM into the Arctic Ocean, although the contribution of this influx is uncertain in terms of the timing of the spring ice melt. Here knowledge of the time scales over which CDOM remains optically active is crucial for understanding the role it plays in the warming of surface waters. The source of the material will affect the reactivity, with fresh marine CDOM being highly labile and quickly removed from the system, and older terrestrial material being more refractory and long lasting. The PI and an associate participated in a spring 2011 ice camp off Ellesmere Island in order to investigate these questions. The objectives of the project were; 1) Determine the sources of CDOM in the surface mixed layer of the western Arctic -- does it come from rivers, is it produced by phytoplankton, or by ice algae? 2) Investigate how quickly and by what mechanism (photochemical or biological) the CDOM degrades 3) Determine the impact of the CDOM on solar heating, thermal stratification, and ice melt.

The active-layer network of 168 sites represents the only coordinated and standardized program of observations using standard measurement protocols designed to observe and detect decadal changes in the dynamics of seasonal thawing and freezing in high-latitude soils. The Intellectual Merit of this study lies in the need for long-term time series of active layer depth, ground temperature, and thaw settlement measurements at the same locations and across diverse terrain types and regions in order to identify scales of spatial variation, establish trends, and validate models. The data will also contribute to detailed process studies, and validating and developing climate change, ecology, hydrology and geocryology models. Education and outreach are essential components of the Broader Impacts of CALM. The project will provide opportunities for field experience and educational participation at levels ranging from elementary school through postdoctoral. Local, predominantly indigenous people, will assist with the observations at remote sites. CALM will continue to incorporate data into its Web-based database, and transfer all existing and new data to the AON archive CADIS.

Project Closing the Isotope Hydrology at Summit: Measurements of Source Regions, Precipitation and Post-deposition Processes Metadata Principal Investigator: David Noone CO Principal Investigator: Konrad Steffen James White David Schneider Description: The stable isotopic records from the Greenland Ice Sheet are the gold standard for understanding climate variations in the Arctic on decadal to millennial scales. While the basic tenets that underlie interpretation of isotopic information appear robust in a mean sense, meteorological and glaciological processes can confound simple interpretations. Processes of concern are variations in moisture sources, cloud processes, surface ablation, blowing snow and vapor diffusion in the firn. The project objectives are to resolve fundamental uncertainties in the controls on the isotopic composition of the ice sheet through a 3-year measurement campaign at Summit, Eureka and Reykjavik. The project will use measurements and modeling to evaluate 1) the degree to which oxygen isotopic composition and deuterium excess of snow capture variations in moisture sources versus cloud microphysical conditions, and 2) the degree to which blowing snow and vapor diffusion within the firn confound accurate interpretation of variability in the isotopic record. Continuous measurements of the isotopic composition of water vapor and daily measurements of the isotopic composition of freshly-fallen and blowing snow will be made at Summit, Eureka and Reykjavik. These will be combined with measurements of the amount, size distribution, and approximate habit of falling and blowing snow, turbulence measurements to evaluate snow lofting, surface latent heat flux (ablation and frost) and energy balance, and remote sensing of polar clouds and atmospheric structure. High-resolution firn cores will be drilled to reconcile the detailed isotopic measurements and modeling with glaciological records. The new isotope measurements will jump start an emerging international pan-Arctic cooperative network of isotope measurements, which complements Arctic observations under existing Arctic Observing Network activities. The advanced measurements at Summit enhance the site as a comprehensive observatory for monitoring and understanding Arctic change.

Project Cloud Properties Across the Arctic Basin from Surface and Satellite Measurements - An existing Arctic Observing Network Metadata Principal Investigator: Von Walden Collaborating Principal Investigator: Matthew Shupe Description: The work of this research grant involves the integration and analysis of measurements from the surface-based sites at SHEBA (Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic), Barrow, and the new observatory in Eureka, Canada, as well as satellite data over the northern polar region. In effect, this project will coordinate existing, yet disparate, Arctic cloud measurements into a coherent network of observations that are useful for understanding the broader roles of clouds in Arctic climate and for evaluating the performance of global models in the Arctic. The researchers will use measurements from a wide array of data sources to address questions related to the spatial and temporal variability of Arctic clouds. This research work addresses many stated objectives and goals for both SEARCH (Study of Environmental Arctic Change) project. SEARCH has identified the need for long-term observations of important Arctic climate parameters, such as clouds, and has recognized the value of coordinated surface-satellite activities, both of which are fundamental components of this grant. By making the link between disparate observations at multiple sites to a comprehensive, long-term cloud data set, this study is a combination of "Observing Activities" and "Understanding Activities," two components of the SEARCH objectives. The results of this project will be broadly disseminated in various ways. Researchers will give presentations, posters, and slide shows to the scientific community and the general public and research will be used in curriculum development at the University of Idaho. They will also create educational web pages for the general public and for classroom use on Arctic cloud research through our data site.

Project Collaborative Research: A pan-Arctic, storm-by-storm isotopic investigation of the influence of Arctic sea ice on precipitation - a crucial link in the coupled climate system Metadata Principal Investigator: John Burkhart Description: This project will quantify the relationship between the ice-free area of the Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas, and evaporation and precipitation in the Arctic region. The methodology uses isotopic compositions of storm-by-storm precipitation samples, pan-Arctic meteorological data, and numerical modeling. Precipitation samples will be collected at nine Arctic observatories, and by three high schools in Greenland. Samples will be analyzed for D/H and 18O/16O ratios. The track of a given storm will be reconstructed using reanalysis data and a Lagrangian trajectory algorithm. The moisture sources are then localized, and the δ18O, δD and d-excess of the source vapor are calculated using the sea surface temperature, relative humidity and wind speed. The sea ice area transected by each storm will be obtained using high-resolution satellite products. A two-dimensional (2D) model of the atmospheric moisture cycle will be used to compute the isotopic composition of precipitation for each storm at each site using reanalysis values of meteorological variables at the times and regions identified by the Lagrangian back trajectory, and assuming a range of sea ice concentrations. The sea ice concentration that best fits our isotopic measurements is then compared with the satellite sea ice data. The isotope data will thus yield, via the 2D model, the sensitivity of Arctic evaporation and precipitation to ice area. The project will yield a quantitative understanding of the links among sea ice, and moisture sources and amounts of Arctic precipitation, which comprise an important part of climate dynamics on a wide range of time scales. The results will be pertinent to the interpretation of ice core data, ice age dynamics, sudden climate change, and global warming. This project also intends to integrate research with education and outreach, which will directly benefit participating Arctic communities. The project aims to improve community understanding of how climate change research is done, by providing Arctic students with new knowledge and skills, and by inspiring them to pursue advanced studies. At the same time, the PI's will benefit from learning traditional methods of observing, categorizing, and forecasting weather and climate from the communities participating in the study.

Project Collaborative Research: A Synthesis of Existing and New Observations of Air-Snowpack Exchanges to Assess the Arctic Metadata Principal Investigator: Detlev Helmig Description: Chemical and biological processes occuring within, above, and below snowpacks influence tropospheric ozone. Measurements available to date and simplified modeling studies indicate that the resulting impact on tropospheric O3 is significant, but available measurements and current modeling capabilities are insufficient for a quantitative estimate of its magnitude. It is of particular importance to improve our understanding of snowpack-atmosphere O3 exchanges because of ongoing and expected future alterations in snow, sea-ice and permafrost extent resulting from climate change, which will alter snowpack O3 impacts in the future. This project provides an integrated approach to address this need, using field measurements to fill key gaps in current knowledge and synthesizing the new and existing data into a chemistry-climate model. Air-snow exchange fluxes of O3 and NOx (NO+NO2) will be measured at multiple sites with different snow/land types, each for an extended period to capture effects of changing insolation, snowpack properties and (where applicable) soil temperature and soil NOx emissions. Measurements will include O3 and NOx levels and gradients both within and above the snowpack and eddy-correlation O3 fluxes at two heights above the snowpack; ancillary measurements will characterize atmospheric turbulence, actinic flux, micrometeorological parameters and the snowpack's physical and radiative properties. Field locations include Summit, Greenland (representing glacial snowpack), Toolik Lake, Alaska (representing snowpack above permafrost soil and snowpack over frozen lakes) and the Aspen FACE research site operated by Michigan Tech (representing snowpack above biologically active soil). Additional measurements for instrument shakedown at Table Mountain, Colorado, will provide information on intermittent snowpack. New parameterizations of snowpack processes will be developed and incorporated into single column model (SCM) versions of the global chemistry-climate models ECHAM4 and ECHAM5-MESSy. These parameterizations will be designed to describe the underlying processes and to capture variations among the available and new field measurements, which will be used for model evaluation. The new model system will be used to simulate the impact of air-snow O3 and NOx exchange upon the arctic tropospheric O3 budget. This work will close existing gaps in understanding of snowpack processes affecting O3, including O3 uptake to snow and the role of biological activity below snowpacks, NOx release from snow, and boundary layer O3 production resulting from snowpack emissions of O3 precursors. It will provide the first measurements of snow-air O3 and NOx fluxes for snow over permafrost and snow over frozen lakes, and the most thorough measurements available for snow over non-permafrost soil. The new snowpack-exchange model will be a very significant advancement over current simulations of snowpack impacts in chemistry-climate models, and will allow such models to better describe the connections between changing Arctic climate and environmental systems. Its use will produce the first assessment of the impact of snowpack photochemical processes upon the arctic and subarctic tropospheric O3 budget, and will provide the basis for assessing the expected impact that climate change will exert upon the tropospheric O3 budget through changing snowcover and permafrost extent.

Project Collaborative Research: A winter expedition to explore the biological and physical conditions of the Bering, Chukchi, and Southern Beaufort Seas Metadata CO Principal Investigator: Carin Ashjian Robert Campbell Stephen Okkonen Description: This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). Funds are provided to collect baseline winter information on the overwintering physical and biological characteristics of three important Arctic Seas: The Bering Sea, the Chukchi Sea, and the Beaufort Sea. Understanding of seasonality, and particularly winter conditions, in the Arctic is severely limited because of difficulties in accessing these regions during winter and because of limitations to sensor technology that can be deployed on overwintering moorings and ice-tethered profilers/buoys. In particular, understanding of the overwintering strategies of one of the dominant copepod genera, Calanus spp., is not well understood but is critical to ecosystem modeling efforts. This lack of knowledge has compromised our ability to model and to predict Arctic ecosystems, knowledge that is critical to our efforts to understand the potential impacts of ongoing climate change. A 6-week cruise to the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas was conducted during November and December 2011 during which physical (hydrography, circulation), chemical (nutrients), and biological (zooplankton, microzooplankton, chlorophyll) sampling was done to describe the hydrography, circulation and aspects of the planktonic and nutrient environments, identify the overwintering habitat of Calanus spp., determine the condition and activity of Calanus spp. and euphausiids, describe the interconnectedness between species/populations of Calanus and euphausiids in these regions, identify the transformations of Pacific Water on the Chukchi Shelf, describe off-shelf flow of Pacific Water into the Arctic Ocean and the circulation and hydrography of Barrow Canyon, and quantify the course- and fine-scale vertical distributions of plankton and particles in relation to the vertical structure of the water column.

Project Collaborative Research: An Interdisciplinary Monitoring Mooring in the Western Arctic Boundary Current: Climatic Forcing and Ecosystem Response Metadata Principal Investigator: Robert Pickart Collaborating Principal Investigator: Kathleen Stafford Jeremy Mathis Description: Funds are provided to deploy a single, strategically placed mooring in the core of the western Arctic boundary current east of Barrow Canyon, which will collect measurements permitting estimation of both the alongstream and cross-stream fluxes of important physical, chemical, and biological quantities. These measurements will enhance our understanding of the western Arctic ocean-atmosphere-ice system, including crucial aspects of the ecosystem that are unattainable throughout most of the year due to ice cover. Analysis of a previously deployed high-resolution mooring array at the site has enabled the PI to determine the optimal placement and design of the mooring, and has given him insights into the vast amount of information that can be obtained from such a time-series. Using new generation moored profilers, the mooring will provide full-water column traces (from near the seafloor to the underside of the ice) of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, chlorophyll fluorescence, nitrate, backscatter (a proxy for zooplankton) and velocity. In addition, the mooring will provide time-series of ice thickness and ice velocity, bottom pressure, and marine mammal calls.

Project Collaborative Research: An Isotope MIF Study of Volcanic Events in Greenland Ice Cores Metadata Principal Investigator: Jihong Cole-Dai Description: This collaborative study between South Dakota State University and University of California, San Diego will investigate mechanisms of atmospheric oxidation chemistry using sulfur dioxide from volcanic eruptions. The Principal Investigators will: 1) obtain several shallow ice cores from central Greenland; 2) extract sulfate from a number of known large volcanic eruptions in the last 600 years; 3) measure the mass independent fractionation (MIF) of sulfur and oxygen isotopes in the volcanic sulfate; 4) test hypotheses of sulfur dioxide oxidation by active oxidation intermediates and by photochemistry; and 5) investigate the quantitative impact of atmospheric variables on ice core volcanic signals. The goals are to: 1) better understand the chemical processes of atmospheric oxidation and the effect of atmospheric dynamics on ice core volcanic signals, and 2) to establish a new mechanism to track the sensitivity of the atmosphere to environmental disturbance and hence, is of importance to anthropogenic impact models. Intellectual Merit: Oxidation is one of the basic chemical transformation processes in the atmosphere. It plays a critically important role in global biogeochemical cycles and in the removal of many pollutant chemicals from the atmosphere. Introduction of large amounts of chemical substances, from either natural or anthropogenic sources, can alter the atmosphere's oxidative abilities and affect the quality and functions of the atmospheric environment. Very limited knowledge of the mechanisms of atmospheric oxidation, particularly in the stratosphere, hampers the efforts to construct robust models to predict anthropogenic impact on the atmospheric environment. The Principal Investigators recently discovered that MIF isotopic signatures of volcanic sulfate extracted from Antarctica ice cores contain new and valuable information on atmospheric oxidation that is unavailable by other means. Limited data have attracted attention from atmospheric modelers with proposals of alternative photochemical and/or oxidation processes. More isotopic MIF data are needed both to test and to encourage new hypotheses spurred by preliminary results. In an on-going project, they added to the MIF dataset with measurements on volcanic sulfate from South Pole ice cores. This project will produce first volcanic sulfate MIF data from Northern Hemisphere ice cores. They will use the bi-polar volcanic sulfate MIF dataset to: 1) determine the global homogeneity of stratospheric oxidation chemistry, 2) test the hypothesis of stratospheric SO3 photolysis, 3) determine the stratospheric or tropospheric nature and degree of two climatologically important large volcanic eruptions; and 4) establish and verify a quantitative MIF-mass loading relationship that can be used to estimate aerosol impact of past volcanic eruptions from their ice core sulfate signals. Broader Impacts: Achieving the goals of the research will help advance the frontiers of environmental science, particularly in the areas of climate change and human impact. By providing educational and research opportunities to SDSU and UCSD students, the project will promote the integration of research with education and contribute to human resource development in science and engineering. The project will contribute to a current REU chemistry site program at SDSU.

Project Collaborative Research: Controls on the motion of soft-bedded glaciers from hourly to seasonal observations of force budget and basal conditions at Breidamerkurjokull, Iceland Metadata Principal Investigator: Howard Conway Author(s): Lead PI: Ian Howat (Ohio State University), CoPIs: Kenichi Matsuoka, Howard Conway Description: Funds are provided to support a study of the spatial and temporal variability in basal stress regime of Breiðamerkurjökull, a glacier with deformable sediments at its base (a soft-bedded glacier). Soft-bedded ice masses are thought to be particularly sensitive to climate change. Yet, the mechanics of soft-bedded glacier flow remain poorly understood. Current ice sheet and glacier models used to predict future sea level rise rely on largely unconstrained parameterizations of basal shear stress and till rheology, leading to high uncertainties in output. This study will collect and analyze data targeted at elucidating weaknesses in current understanding of soft-bedded glacier motion, thus providing improved quantitative descriptions of the governing physical processes. Taking advantage of Breiðamerkurjökull's accessibility and long history of observations the principal investigators will assemble an unprecedented array of remote-sensing and field data. These data will resolve variations in the glacier stress regime and basal conditions over a range of spatial and temporal scales. This study will develop new and innovative techniques for inferring basal conditions from observations of surface motion and ice-penetrating radar.

Project Collaborative Research: Development of an Ice-Tethered Winch for the Seasonal Ice Zone Metadata Principal Investigator: Emily Shroyer Richard Krishfield Description: To help fill the data gap that exists in oceanic observations over the Arctic shelf, we have developed a new autonomous profiler, the Ice-Tethered Winch (ITW). The ice-tethered winch (ITW) combines the design of two established technologies, the Ice-Tethered Profiler (ITP) and Arctic Winch. Merging these technologies allows for expansion upon their individual capabilities by creating a new instrument that can both telemeter subsurface data from beneath the ice and profile the water column over variable depths. The ITW provides relatively high resolution (four profiles daily with sub-meter vertical resolution) time series of water-column physical and optical properties, including temperature, salinity, pressure, turbidity, and chlorophyll. The ITW can transition between an Eulerian platform when tethered to landfast ice and a semi-Lagrangian drifter when in open water. More information about the project and full data records can be found through the ITW and ITP websites, respectively (see related links).

Project Collaborative Research: Diamonds and Oil from the Tundra: A System Study on the Impact of Changing Seasons on Mining and Oil Exploration Metadata Principal Investigator: Matthew Sturm CO Principal Investigator: Thomas Douglas Description: Natural resource extraction is the backbone of the arctic economy. Oil and gas exploration and production taxes account for 88% of the State of Alaska's revenue, providing $10.2 billion in fiscal year 2008. In addition, 4,400 direct and 37,344 indirect Alaskan jobs are due to this industry. In Canada, oil and gas are also crucial to the economy, but so too is diamond mining, with a total value of diamond extraction in the Northwest Territories of $2 billion in 2007. As a result, Canada is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. The mines employ about 4,000 people, roughly 35% of whom are Aboriginal. These arctic oil, gas, and mining activities occur predominantly in remote locations off the all-weather road system, so alternate forms of transport of fuel, equipment, and people are heavily used. In Alaska, oil exploration occurs in winter under state regulations that require sufficient snow and frost to protect the tundra. In Canada, trucks take thousands of loads up a 600-km ice road to supply the diamond mines with fuel and material. These essential winter operations hinge on predictable seasonal transitions (summer-to-winter; winter-to-summer) and cryospheric conditions, but data indicate the spring thaw comes as much as 3 weeks earlier than 50 years ago, and lake and river ice break up earlier than before. These seasonal shifts are already having an adverse impact on minerals and oil/gas activities in the North, with a trickledown impact on local and Northern economies. No formal economic-based analysis has been done to assess how changing seasonal patterns are impacting these vital industries of the North. This research will conduct a pilot effort to identify means of answering this question, as well as two ancillary questions: How are anticipated changes in cryosphere seasonality likely to affect such economic performance in the next decade? and Are there adaptive strategies that can reduce the sensitivity of these key industrial sectors to future changes? This pilot effort will focus on how changing seasons impact the Canadian diamond mining operations in the Northwest Territories through alteration of the reliable period when ice roads can be utilized, increased variability of that open period, and the economic consequences of uncertainty. Here they will use combined economic and cryospheric models to examine the impact of season length on the regional economy. Researchers will observe how environmental data are collected in the field, how they are utilized by regulatory agencies to make decisions, and how businesses weigh climate impacts with other factors in their operations. Based on these studies, the team will isolate the impact of climate-driven changes in seasons from the other factors. The outcome of the project will be explicit information on the extent to which climate-driven changes in seasons are affecting ice road use. More generally, it will be a methodology (including modeling) of how to distinguish climate drivers from non-climate drivers for uniquely Northern businesses.

Project Collaborative Research: Do Holocene Variations In Arctic Sea Ice And Greenland Icebergs Drifting Through Denmark Strait Reflect Natural Cycles Metadata Principal Investigator: Dennis Darby Description: Historical observations and theory suggest the importance of the extent and duration of drift ice on the Climate System through changes in the Hemispheric albedo and the impact of freshwater export from the Arctic Ocean and Greenland Ice Sheet on the Thermohaline Circulation. Funds are provided to develop 50-100 yr resolution records of changes in sea ice export from the Arctic Ocean and iceberg transport from tidewater ice streams of NE Greenland that reach the Denmark Strait and to develop a detailed history of ice-rafted debris (IRD) over the last 12,000 cal yr BP. Denmark Strait is believed to be a critical area for study as it lies at the boundary between the southward export of Polar and Arctic waters and the northwestern limb of the North Atlantic Drift in the form of the Irminger Current. The research will explore a sources-to-sink model along the ENE/E Greenland shelf and across the Denmark Strait using sediment characteristics to document spatial and temporal changes in composition in a series of well-dated, high-resolution cores from either side of the Denmark Strait and along the NE Greenland shelf. This information will be used to infer changes in the transport of sea ice through the Denmark Strait. Given the ongoing observations of changing sea ice character in the Arctic, changes in the flux of sea ice into the Greenland-Norwegian Seas and the North Atlantic Ocean, and possible acceleration of ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet through iceberg calving, a better understanding of how these processes varied in the past will help inform projections of future climate variations. This project will develop data sets that contribute to that understanding.

Project Collaborative Research: Environmental changes alter the carbon cycle of High Arctic ecosystems: shifts in the ages and sources of CO2 and DOC Metadata Principal Investigator: Sean Schaeffer Claudia Czimczik Adam Csank Jeffrey Welker Joshua Schimel Description: The Arctic is undergoing structural and functional changes that appear to be the result of climate change, including shifts in vegetation distribution, increases in CO2 and CH4 efflux from ecosystems to the atmosphere, and the acceleration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export from land to oceans. Research in NW Greenland has produced four lines of evidence that climate change is affecting the High Arctic C cycle in ways we do not fully understand. First, soil organic C pools in polar semi-deserts, which occupy 1 x 106 km2 of the Arctic land surface, may be at least 6× greater than previous estimates, and ancient (>30 ky BP) and young soil C pools are present in the active layer. Second, CO2 ecosystem exchange measurements have consistently shown net C losses during the growing season; these C losses are, however, reversed under warmer and wetter conditions and with modest snow depth increases during the previous winter. In situ ecosystem respiration has been found to increase by 25 and 35% with experimental summer warming of 1.3 and 2.4°C, respectively, but by 50% when the higher level of warming was combined with irrigation. Third, soil CO2 efflux measurements indicate that ancient soil C is being degraded by microbes before vegetation leaf-out. Losses are expected to continue throughout the growing season, but masked by high rates of plant respiration (recently-fixed C) during the mid-summer. Forth, interannual and temporal patterns of riverine DOC are not explained by simple differences in summer weather conditions. Articulating the magnitudes of CO2 and CH4 exchange and DOC export along with the ages of soil respired CO2 and DOC in soil solution and rivers, and determining the sensitivity of microbial degradation of different soil C pools to temperature and moisture will transform our understanding of environmental change, ecosystem function and C cycling in the Arctic. This study will address these questions: 1. How does the age (recently-fixed vs. older) of soil respired CO2 and DOC change over the course of a year, to what extent is this influenced by inter-annual variability in temperature and precipitation, and how does it correspond with the patterns of CO2 and CH4 fluxes? 2. To what extent do long-term experimental increases in temperature (+2 and + 4oC), and in water inputs (summer rain and winter snow) alter the ages, magnitudes, and patterns of C fluxes (CO2, CH4, and DOC)? 3. Are there differences in the extent of microbial degradation of young as opposed to older soil C pools and how sensitive are the degradation rates to changes in climate?

Project Collaborative Research: Eurasian and Makarov basins observational network targets changes in the Arctic Ocean Metadata Principal Investigator: Igor Polyakov Description: Responding to urgent needs for a long-term multidisciplinary observation system for understanding rapid high-latitude climate change in the Arctic Ocean, a Eurasian and Makarov Basin (EMB) observational network is proposed as an element of the Arctic Observing Network (AON). Three August-September cruises, one every two years, will be conducted, with extensive measurements along continental margins, a boundary current conduit; cruises will cover vast areas from Svalbard to the East Siberian Sea. The program ties together oceanographic, chemical, and ice observations using moorings, repeated oceanographic sections, and Lagrangian drifters to provide vital information about Arctic Ocean changes. The overarching goal of the study as an AON element is to compile a cohesive picture of the state and transformations of Atlantic Water (AW) in the EMB, with particular focus on three major observational targets: (1) along-slope AW transport by the boundary currents (2) interaction of AW branches with shelf waters, deep basin interior and upper ocean (3) EMB indications of changes in the upper ocean circulation. The proposed targets are broad in scope and pose a wide range of challenges to modern high-latitude observational oceanography. The EMB's size and location mean that this part of the Arctic Ocean is representative of pan-arctic conditions and processes, and therefore appropriate for long-term observing. Therefore, the project is an important element of the pan-AON. Graduate students will be supported; female and Alaska Native students will be encouraged to participate. Program outreach will culminate in 2013 with a shipboard summer school. Data and products, critically-needed benchmarks for Arctic satellite sea-ice and altimeter measurements, will be available per AON data policy.

Project Collaborative Research: Glacier-Ocean Coupling in a Large East Greenland Fjord Metadata Principal Investigator: Gordon Hamilton CO Principal Investigator: David Sutherland Description: This award will support a study of glacier-fjord interactions in east Greenland. The 'Intellectual Merit' of the proposed study lies in the current understanding that the contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet to sea level rise more than doubled in the last seven years, mostly because of a widespread and nearly simultaneous acceleration of many glaciers that terminate at tidewater in deep fjords. Understanding the causes of changes in glacier dynamics, and predicting their future trajectories is a topic of enormous scientific and societal importance. The Greenland fjords provide an intimate connection between the ice sheet and the ocean and, in turn, raise the possibility that the observed warming of the ocean around southeast and western Greenland was the trigger for recent changes in outlet glacier dynamics. A pilot study conducted by the PIs in east Greenland, and a separate study in west Greenland, found warm ocean waters in the proximity of Helheim Glacier and Jakobshavn Isbræ, respectively, supporting the hypothesis that their acceleration was triggered by ocean warming. While intriguing, the presence of warm waters in Greenland's fjords alone is not enough to conclude that the ocean is modulating glacier dynamics. A test of this hypothesis requires a more detailed understanding of glacier/fjord interactions than is possible with the limited amount of data currently available. This study will fill this gap by investigating glacier-ocean interactions in a typical glacier-fjord system in East Greenland (Sermilik Fjord and Helheim Glacier) through an intensive two-year field program. Through summer surveys and year-round moored instruments, the circulation and properties of the fjord on tidal to yearly time-scales will be mapped, and the liquid fresh water flux out of the fjord will be quantified. A collaboration with Greenlandic marine biologists will allow important ocean data in the region outside the fjord to be obtained using tagged seals. GPS methods and remote sensing will allow changes in the flow behavior of Helheim Glacier to be examined in the context of changing fjord circulation. Satellite remote sensing and field tracking of large icebergs will provide estimates of the solid export of fresh water and its variability. The proposed study has numerous 'Broader Impacts'. The are likely to be a significant component of next-generation ice sheet models seeking to predict the evolution of the Greenland Ice Sheet and future rates of sea level rise. The project brings together an inter-disciplinary group of investigators, involves two junior scientists embarking on their careers, and initiates an international collaboration with Greenlandic scientists. A graduate student will be trained in glaciology and physical oceanography, contributing to society's need for experts in the area of ice sheet-ocean interactions. The fieldwork utilizes local vessels and relies strongly on the knowledge of generations of local hunters who have navigated Sermilik Fjord, thus fostering a two-way exchange between the local community and foreign scientists. A non-technical report summarizing the findings of ocean-glacier measurements will distributed in the local community, which is vulnerable to rapid environmental changes affecting its primary natural resource.

Project Collaborative research: Glacier seismicity and its relationship to basal movement Metadata Principal Investigator: Neal Iverson Peter Moore CO Principal Investigator: Denis Cohen Description: A major unknown in the estimation of the effects of climate warming is the rate of sea level rise. This is believed to be significantly impacted by the transfer of mass from ice sheets and glaciers to the ocean, both as melt water runoff and as ice bergs. The temporal and spatial variability of glacier sliding is responsible for the most dynamic behavior of ice masses. Microseismicity measured on glacier surfaces contains information about basal movement, including slip velocity and displacement, slip areas, and basal shear stresses. However, extracting this information from seismicity is highly uncertain due to a lack of direct measurements at glacier beds that can be used to guide seismological inversions. Without such guidance, the seismological methods used extensively to characterize slip along crustal faults will continue to be underutilized for revealing characteristics of slip beneath modern ice masses. The PIs propose to locally induce rapid glacier slip, measure it directly at the bed, and study the seismic expression of that slip. This work can be accomplished only at the Svartisen Ice Cap in Norway, where tunnels in subglacial rock provide unusual access to the bed of a thick sliding glacier. At this facility, important experimental capabilities exist. Basal motion and water pressure can be measured continuously at multiple locations, shear tractions on the bed can be measured locally, seismicity can be measured subglacially, and basal water pressure can be increased during pump tests that perturb 10-50 m2 of the bed. Two sets of measurements will be made and repeated the following year. In April prior to significant melting on the glacier surface, pump tests will be conducted to bring the basal water pressure above the ice-overburden pressure, inducing local slip. Resultant seismicity will be measured at multiple locations, both at the glacier surface and in tunnels within rock beneath the glacier. Hypocenter location, slip kinematics, and basal shear stresses inferred from surface seismicity will be compared with direct subglacial measurements and with seismic data gathered subglacially to test and calibrate methods of seismological inversion. During May and June, natural seismicity will be monitored and interpreted, as fluctuating water input to the bed causes variations in water pressure and storage. Results will help optimize the use of microseismicity for studying basal movement remotely over large areas of glacier beds and will be relevant to the study of all sliding ice masses, regardless of their bed type, size, or location.

The Proof of the Drill Metadata Principal Investigator: Joel Harper Description: Recent changes in the flow dynamics and overall geometry of the Greenland Ice Sheet have been concurrent with increased surface melting: the velocity of some outlet glaciers has increased, the ice sheet margins have thinned, and the overall mass of the ice sheet has declined by more than melt alone can account for. A direct linkage between surface melt and ice sheet change is commonly argued but has not been proven. In the proposed work, direct connections between surface melt, the basal hydrological system, and ice motion will be quantified along a flow-line transect of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The region to be studied receives high surface melt, but is located far from the influence of ocean tidewater dynamics. Basal conditions will be directly measured in six boreholes drilled to the bed, with two holes at each of three sites. Surface melt and spatial gradients in ice velocity will be quantified to enable detailed comparison between melt water forcing, basal hydrologic conditions, and ice flow dynamics. Instrumentation at the surface, within the ice, and at the bed will collect data at high time resolution for up to 2 years. Two models will be used to interpret the mechanical and thermal context of the measurements. In turn, the intensive measurement campaign will uniquely constrain the modeling and enable model assessment. This integrated measurement and modeling campaign will be a comprehensive investigation of the role of water in ice sheet motion. This work will support two Ph.D. dissertations and provide field research experiences to at least five students. Several informal education and outreach activities will be supported, including a high proportion of Native American participants.

Project Collaborative Research: Greenland Ice Sheet Snow Accumulation Variability: Filling Knowledge and Data Voids Metadata Principal Investigator: Richard Forster Jason Box Description: The award will support an investigation of snow accumulation in the south-eastern sector of the Greenland ice sheet. Snow accumulation rates on the Greenland ice sheet have been significantly underestimated and the missing mass prevents accurate estimates of the overall ice sheet mass balance. The south-eastern sector of the ice sheet contains the largest proportion of the missing mass. Consequently, this study will measure snow accumulation using new and existing firn cores along two transects in the south-east Greenland data void and, by combining the firn core records with ground-penetrating radar surveys, develop continuous accumulation transects between 2500 m and 500 m elevation. Successful completion of the investigation will fill a geographic gap in knowledge of accumulation on the Greenland ice sheet, and the data will have broader scientific value for remote sensing of accumulation and ice sheet mass balance, and ice sheet and climate modeling. In addition to the scientific benefits, the 'Broader Impacts' of the investigation include a comprehensive suite of informal and formal education and outreach activities for all age groups. Notable among these is a collaboration with the Utah Museum of Natural History that includes the development of a display about snow accumulation in Greenland, hosting a workshop for teachers, and project scientists' participation in "Scientist in the Spotlight" and "Science Movie Night" series.

Project Collaborative Research: Greenland Meltwater Geomicrobiology Metadata Principal Investigator: Karen Junge CO Principal Investigator: Ronald Sletten Birgit Hagedorn Brent Christner Description: The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is the largest freshwater reservoir in the Arctic. Melting of the GrIS is increasing, delivering large amounts of freshwater to the Arctic Ocean. The nature and composition of microbial communities below the GrIS are not known, but recent studies have documented the presence of viable microbial communities in other subglacial environments and within the GrIS ice itself, indicating their potential importance for chemical weathering processes. This project will characterize GrIS? subglacial microbial communities to investigate the effect of microbes on lithospheric weathering and nutrient fluxes from the GrIS margin in West Greenland. The hypothesis is that the glacial thermal regime and bedrock lithology are the primary determinants of the subglacial bacterial communities, which in turn mediate nutrient release and weathering rates. Study sites in the Thule and Kangerlusuaq areas cover two major lithologies of West Greenland. The study combines state-of-the art microbiological, biogeochemical techniques, and datalogging of stream and climate parameters, to examine glacial meltwater. It is anticipated that the melting of the GrIS will have large effects on global biogeochemical cycles, ocean ecology, and atmospheric CO2. GrIS subglacial microbes are anticipated to play an important role in mobilizing elements from the lithosphere. Data generated on the diversity of GrIS microbes (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya) will provide an initial assessment of microbial richness and diversity in aquatic habitats beneath the GrIS. The primary objective is to examine the biodiversity and microbial contribution to geochemical processes and nutrient release, and this study will also provide insight into low temperature adaptation of life in and to a hitherto unexamined subglacial environment. A synergistic relationship with the WISSARD (Whillams Ice Stream Subglacial Access Research Drilling) project will provide the opportunity for a bipolar comparison of biodiversity beneath the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets. Providing data of chemical composition and fluxes of meltwater (particularly carbon, iron and trace nutrients) and sediments released by the GrIS will provide a framework to assess potential feedbacks in global biogeochemical models. Detailed measurements over two melting seasons will provide fundamental data towards a conceptual model of GrIS? subglacial microbial environments.

Project Collaborative Research: High-resolution studies of glacier dynamics at two major outlet glaciers in East Greenland Metadata Principal Investigator: Gordon Hamilton Description: The Principal Investigators request support for an interdisciplinary, high-resolution study involving remote sensing and field investigations at two of Greenland's largest outlet glaciers. The study of the Helheim and Kangerdlugssuaq Glaciers will integrate seismological, glaciological, and geodetic observations to build an understanding of flow dynamics at major outlet glaciers, which represent a critical junction between the atmosphere, cryosphere, and hydrosphere. The project would be the first long-term occupation of an outlet glacier by a GPS receiver network, and would address questions of flow variation on earthquake to interannual time scales. Recent discoveries have made it clear that our understanding of the dynamics of flow at large outlet glaciers is limited and inadequate for understanding the ways in which the outlet glaciers, and the ice sheets they drain, respond to external forcings. The spectrum of timescales over which significant velocity variations in outlet glacier flow can occur appears to be much broader than previously believed, with significant variations occurring on timescales of 10s of seconds to several years. Analysis of glacial earthquakes suggests that significant volumes of ice may move at speeds 1000 times faster than their average annual velocities for periods of a minute or two and a doubling of average annual flow speeds over only a few years has been observed at some glaciers. Multiple observations now indicate that glacier flow behavior can respond quickly to environmental changes, including rapid climate change. It is not currently clear, however, what mechanisms or combination of mechanisms allow for, or drive, the temporal variations, nor is it clear how variations in flow behavior at different timescales are related to one another. Understanding the changes in force balance that control variations across the range of timescales from minutes to years requires observations at higher resolution in both space and time than are currently available, and achieving a comprehensive picture of the interactions between short- and long-timescale processes, and between external forcings and glacier flow behavior, requires the integration of data and expertise from several traditionally separate disciplines.. Intellectual Merit. The research will lead to a greatly improved understanding of the dynamics of flow at the large, fast-moving outlet glaciers that drain the Greenland ice sheet and of the temporal variability in their rates and modes of flow. It will provide insight into the processes controlling glacial earthquakes and possible connections between glacial-earthquake activity and global climate change. Broader Impacts. Understanding the controls on flow configuration at major outlet glaciers, and the timescales over which they may respond to climatic forcing, is of great importance for proper modeling of systems affected by the transfer of fresh polar meltwater to the world's oceans. A better understanding of glacier and ice-sheet response to climate change will allow for improvements in modeling of the coupled ice ocean atmosphere system, and of its interactions with the solid Earth. The geodetic instrumentation and processing techniques developed under this proposal will benefit researchers in a variety of environments such as glacier and volcano monitoring involving rapid, large-scale motions and the risk of instrument loss.

Project Collaborative Research: Linking belowground phenology and ecosystem function in a warming Arctic Metadata Principal Investigator: Patrick Sullivan CO Principal Investigator: Jeffrey Welker Description: This project comprises a four-year, passive warming experiment of low-Arctic tundra vegetation at a long-term study site in Greenland, with the primary aim of measuring the response of plant roots to warming, and the role of this response in ecosystem carbon exchange. Phenology, the annual timing and progression of events such as aboveground plant growth, is a well-studied an important component of the ecology of climate change, but remains under-studied belowground. This study will estimate and compare above- and belowground responses of plant phenology to warming and their respective contributions to ecosystem function, specifically the exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and tundra. It will furthermore determine which plant types, e.g., shrubs or grasses, show the greater belowground response to warming and contribution to ecosystem carbon exchange. Novel insights into the expected response of the Arctic to climate change will emerge from this experiment, which will also expand the infrastructure for field-based experimental and observational research in the Arctic. This research will promote the involvement of under-represented groups by recruitment of students through Penn State?s Minority Undergraduate Research Experience program, and promote education and dissemination of its results through a summer field ecology module at the study site and in courses at Penn State and the University of Alaska-Anchorage. Results will also be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences by participating students and the Principal Investigators.

Project Collaborative Research: Long-term observations in the Switchyard region of the Arctic Ocean as part of the Arctic Observing Network Metadata Principal Investigator: William Smethie Jr. Craig Lee Peter Schlosser CO Principal Investigator: Michael Steele Taro Takahashi Dale Chayes Jason Gobat Description: The project Collaborative Research: Long-term observations in the Switchyard region of the Arctic Ocean as part of the Arctic Observing Network (NSF Award Numbers 1022475 and 1023529) is a continuation of the work of the AON project A Modular Approach to Building an Arctic Observing System for the IPY and Beyond in the Switchyard Region of the Arctic Ocean (NSF Award Numbers 0633878 and 0633885,) from April 2007 to March 2011 and Collaborative Research: Circulation in the freshwater switchyard of the Arctic Ocean (NSF Award Numbers 0230238 and 0230427) from Jan 2003  December 2007. These continued awards support a further three years (2011 - 2013) of ocean observations in the 'Switchyard region', the area north of Ellesmere Island, Canada, and Greenland, where water flows south out of the Arctic Ocean via Fram and Nares straits. The 'Switchyard' observing effort is part of the NSF Arctic Observing Network (AON), which supports long-term, science-driven observing that enables research into understanding rapid environmental system change in the Arctic. AON is a component of the broader Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH). The key elements of the 'Switchyard' observations are: (1) An aircraft-based section using a CTD-O/rosette system between Alert and the North Pole of hydrographic properties and a set of tracers/carbon system variables aimed at resolving the relative age structure via CFC, SF6 and tritium/helium-3 measurements, and freshwater components via oxygen-18, salinity and nutrient measurements in the upper water column (2) An aircraft-based hydrography/tracer survey of the Lincoln Sea aimed at capturing changes in the regional freshwater routing and the front between the boundary current and the transpolar drift passing through the 'Switchyard' region   (3) A mooring array across the shelf slope just west of Nares Strait aimed at capturing the structure and transport of the water masses coming around the Canada Basin on their way to Nares and Fram straits. Successful completion of the award will extend the 'Switchyard' observational record to 10 years, which will allow researchers to improve the understanding of the following: (1) Water mass characteristics and their effect on stratification, diapycnal heat fluxes, and transport of heat and salt (2) Freshwater inventories (including that stored in form of sea ice) (3) Freshwater release to the North Atlantic Ocean (4) Heat budget of the upper water layers and its interplay with the sea ice cover (5) Sea ice circulation and thickness distribution (6) Future circulation patterns Broader Impacts: The Arctic is undergoing a transition into a warmer world, and the data obtained in the 'Switchyard' region will provide early indications of how the Arctic environmental system is responding to anthropogenic forcing.

Project Collaborative Research: Multi-Regional Scale Aircraft Observations of Methane and Carbon Dioxide Isotopic Fluxes in the Arctic Metadata Principal Investigator: David Sayres Description: This proposal directly addresses the release of carbon dioxide and methane from terrestrial melt zones and ocean systems that result from the loss of the Arctic Ocean ice cover. Airborne measurements of the fluxes of isotopologues of methane and carbon dioxide will be conducted using a new spectrometer system developed at Harvard under an NSF MRI initiative. This instrument has sufficient precision and accuracy to distinguish between thermogenic and biogenic sources of carbon in the Arctic, as well as measuring N2O and water vapor, as well as other tracers. NOAA?s Atmospheric Turbulence and Division Division (ATDD) bring their expertise in field deployments of airborne flux systems as well as a Best Air Turbulence (BAT) probe to the field mission. The broader impacts of the proposed activity emerge from the unique measurements and monitoring strategy of this project to develop a foundation for a national carbon monitoring network, which will be a key component of any program or international agreement to limit carbon emissions. The project will fill a technological void and deliver a system that is versatile by design, allowing for myriad future applications that are centered on specific carbon-related issues, such as sequestration and forest chemistry, as well as assessing the overall country-by-country inventory of carbon.

Project Collaborative Research: Nonlinearities in the Arctic climate system during the Holocene Metadata Principal Investigator: Zicheng Yu Matthew Wooller Raymond Bradley Mark Abbott Description: Rapid changes in the arctic climate system that occurred in the relatively recent past can be compared with the output of climate models to improve the understanding of the processes responsible for nonlinear system change. This study focuses on the transition between the Holocene thermal maximum (HTM) and the onset of Neoglaciation, and on the step-like changes that occurred subsequently during the late Holocene. The millennial-scale cooling trend that followed the HTM coincides with the decrease in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation driven by slow changes in Earth's orbit. Despite the nearly linear forcing, the transition from the HTM to the Little Ice Age (1500-1900 AD) was neither gradual nor uniform. To understand how feedbacks and perturbations result in rapid changes, a geographically distributed network of proxy climate records will be used to study the spatial and temporal patterns of change, and to quantify the magnitude of change during these transitions. The researchers of this collaborative project will use lacustrine sediments to produce 13 new high-resolution proxy climate records of the past 8000 years. The study sites form two focus regions (eastern Beringia and the NW Atlantic) that generally coincide with the nodes of the surface temperature expression of the Arctic Oscillation (AO). This effort will nearly double the number of high-resolution lacustrine records that extend through the last two millennia, and will generate some of the first high resolution records that capture the HTM. During the HTM, summer sea-ice cover over the Arctic Ocean was likely the smallest of the present interglacial period; certainly it was less extensive than at any time in the past 100 years, and therefore affords an opportunity to investigate a period of warmth similar to what is projected during the coming century. This study focuses on lakes because lakes are the most widely distributed sources of proxy climate records that consistently extend through the post-glacial interval. Because climate change is amplified in the Arctic, the climate signal preserved in arctic lake sediments should be stronger than elsewhere. The proxy records generated in this project will use conventional and newly emerging techniques to document the spatio-temporal patterns of abrupt environmental changes, and to derive quantitative estimates of past summer temperature and hydroclimate variables. Most lakes have been cored previously and show potential for generating high-quality proxy records. Five of the lakes contain laminated sediment with annually resolved records; others have high sedimentation rates (>0.5 mm yr-1) for sub-decadal resolution across the climate transitions. Confidence in the paleoclimate reconstructions will be bolstered by a multi-proxy approach, and by replicate lake records in each of the focus regions that will be used to distinguish basin-scale thresholds from regional-scale climate shifts. This project builds on on-going climate-modeling experiments that use NCAR's Climate System Model (CCSM3) to study the sensitivities of the arctic system to volcanism and solar variability. A new data-model comparison proposed for this study will test whether the most prominent changes in the arctic system during the past 8 ka, as reconstructed from the proxy records, can be explained by a plausible combination of system-component conditions coincident with prolonged volcanism. The experiments, conducted with NCAR collaborators, will focus on the elements of the Arctic system (e.g., AO and extent of sea ice) that participate in abrupt transitions, and that might elicit nonlinear changes in the future.

Project Collaborative Research: P2C2--Ice Core Paleoclimate Records from Combatant Col, British Columbia, Canada Metadata Principal Investigator: Eric Steig CO Principal Investigator: Peter Neff Erin Pettit Doug Clark Joseph McConnell Description: Funding is provided to obtain new ice core accumulation records from Combatant Col, Mt. Waddington, in southwestern British Columbia (BC), Canada. Combatant Col is located significantly farther south than other existing ice core sites along the west coast of North America and variations in precipitation tend to be out of phase with those in Alaska and the Yukon. Combatant Col sits at 3000 meters and contains more than 200 meters of ice. The net annual snow accumulation is ~2.5 meters/year and the mean annual temperature -5°C. A 65-meter core from the site shows that clear annual layering is preserved in the geochemistry and in dust and black carbon. The age of the ice near bedrock is estimated to be between 200 years and 1000 years old. It is anticipated that an annually-resolved record of layer thickness will be recovered at the site to allow for a record of snow accumulation covering the last 200-1000 years. The Combatant Col record, in combination with other existing records of precipitation variability along the western margin of North America, will be used to develop an updated and improved reconstruction of precipitation variability in this region over the last 200-1000 years to address fundamental questions about Pacific decadal scale variability. The broader impacts involve supporting an early career female investigator and strengthening international collaborations with researchers from institutions in Canada.

Project Collaborative Research: Science Coordination Office for Summit Station and the Greenland Traverse Metadata Principal Investigator: John Burkhart Description: The Science Coordination Office (SCO) serves the scientific community, NSF/OPP, and the arctic logistics contractor by coordinating input and providing an organized mechanism for OPP to consult with regarding decisions at Summit Station. SCO makes recommendations to CPS about ways to accommodate or mitigate conflicting requests from different science teams, as well as suggesting ways investigators might accomplish science objectives with smaller logistical impacts. SCO advocates on behalf of the community, suggesting science-based priorities for capital investments by OPP at Summit that will maintain and enhance the value of the site for research while striving to keep the station financially sustainable. This proposal includes two new members to SCO in order to represent the broader research community and diversify generations of researchers. This proposal adds functionality to the existing SCO. SCO will discuss research projects on the Greenland Inland Traverse and future research sites on the Greenland Ice Sheet hosting investigations similar to work done at Summit Station. Activities that expand communication in this proposal include significant updates to the current GEOSummit webpage such as incorporation of a virtual tour, Summit bibliography, and Summit GIS. SCO will create a Summit Listserv and host communication events such as a town hall style meeting at the Fall AGU meeting, increased effort at informal direct contact, and semi-annual teleconferences involving the scientific community. The SCO role in long-range and annual planning is to focus on the economic and environmental sustainability of the station in parallel with the preservation of core station scientific activities. These objectives are captured in a developing Long-range Plan for Summit Station.

Project Collaborative Research: Seasonal Synergy between Bacterial Osmoprotection and Algal Production in Sea Ice Metadata Principal Investigator: Jody Deming Collaborating Principal Investigator: Roy Collins Description: The amount of primary production attributable to sea ice algae is seasonally and quantitatively important to current arctic marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. Although light and nutrients have been studied for decades as the determinants of ice-algal production, more complex synergistic effects between ice algae and other microbial residents of sea ice that may foster primary production are poorly known. Studies of sea-ice bacteria and algae, including genomic evaluations, have revealed potential links between compounds called compatible solutes (CS), commonly used by microbes to protect against osmotic shock (death by cell explosion) in high-salinity surroundings, and the availability of regenerated nitrogen within the ice. This research will test a seasonal-synergy hypothesis whereby CS precursor compounds (like choline) that are released by ice algae during fall freeze-up are taken up by bacteria in the ice, converted to CS for survival in the high-salinity brines of winter sea ice, and then metabolized for carbon, nitrogen and energy as spring temperatures warm, salinities freshen, and the need to retain CS as osmoprotectants diminishes. An important end product of this bacterial conversion of CS is ammonia, increasing the within-ice availability of nitrogen to ice algae on the verge of blooming as photosynthetically active radiation penetrates the ice. Elements of this proposed seasonal synergy between bacteria and algae encased in sea ice will be examined by a combination of field and laboratory approaches. Sea-ice brines will be collected during fall freeze-up and spring-bloom periods and tested for bacterial uptake of choline, conversion to CS, and remineralization, using radiolabeled and stable isotope-based incubations and spectroscopic methods. The latter will reveal the key bacterial phylotypes responsible for a CS-based seasonal synergy within sea ice. Measurements of temperature, salinity, pH, bacterial and viral abundances, chlorophyll pigments, and extracellular polysaccharide substances will provide environmental and biological context. Pure cultures of available and newly acquired (on CS- based media) sea-ice bacteria will be examined across temperature and salinity gradients to clarify the key processes. This award will help to launch the faculty career of a polar early career scientist and provide unique training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students in the field, in the laboratory, at the computer, and in outreach efforts in Washington State, Alaska and Greenland. By conducting the proposed field research from the Greenland Climate Research Center in Nuuk, Greenland, this US team will foster international cooperation among scientists from the US, Greenland and Denmark, adding to the outcome and continuing pan-Arctic goals of the recently completed International Polar Year.

We have analyzed the seasonality of Arctic sea ice concentrations, land surface temperatures and NDVI and how they have changed over the satellite record. These regional time series are provided in the data archive. We have investigated additional remote sensing data (e.g. snow), climate data (e.g. Reanalysis Data), WRF modeling, and ocean assimilation (heat content) information to advance our understanding of how and why the tundra is changing.

Project Collaborative Research: Shifting seasonality of Arctic river hydrology alters key biotic linkages among aquatic systems Metadata Collaborating Principal Investigator: Bruce Peterson Alexander Huryn Description: This research will determine how the shifting seasonality of arctic river hydrology alters key biotic linkages within and among lake and stream components of watersheds and may alter the function of the arctic system. Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) is a quintessential, circumpolar arctic species that provides a model system for understanding the impacts of changing seasonality on arctic ecosystem function because an interconnected and varied landscape (large tundra rivers, small streams and lakes) is required to maintain their population viability. Changes to environmental conditions that disrupt their migration will affect the system-level function of aquatic ecosystems. Grayling serve as food for other biota, including lake trout, birds and humans, and as top-down controls in stream ecosystems suggesting that changes to their populations will have effects that reverberate throughout the coupled river-lake system. The scale and pace of the changes now impacting tundra lakes and streams imparts an urgency to understand how they are linked and how they function as a system. This work will address 4 questions: 1) How are seasonality, rate and distance of grayling migration affected by climate change? 2) Are the seasonality of life-cycles, life-history and attributes of stream insect populations changing in response to climate change? 3) How does changing seasonality of river discharge interact with insect production to affect availability and transfer of stream production to grayling? 4) What is the effect of climate driven disruption of the migratory link on the structure and function of winter refugia?

Project Collaborative research: Sinking rates and nutritional quality of organic mater exported from sea ice; the importance of exopolymeric substances Metadata Principal Investigator: Susanne Neuer Andrew Juhl Description: Available data concerning the sinking rates of ice algae are highly divergent, while the characteristics of particles formed from other large organic pools in sea ice have received little study. As an initial step to remedy this situation, funds are provided to study the role of exopolymeric substances (EPS), produced by ice algae, in particle formation. The importance of EPS to particle coagulation and sinking rate is well established for temperate water columns. In sea ice, EPS comprise 20-70% of total particulate organic carbon, but their role in the sinking rate and composition of particles exported from sea ice is poorly understood. Based on previous studies, the PIs predict both positive and negative effects of EPS on particle sinking rate depending on EPS quantity. EPS also is predicted to increase the ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) in the organic matter, which serves as a nutritional indicator. Based on documented trends in the EPS content of first-year Arctic sea ice, the PIs specifically predict slower sinking rates and higher C:N in particles produced after the export of ice algae, and from the upper levels of the ice column. They also predict slower sinking rates and higher C:N where snow cover is thicker. They will measure the sinking rates of particles released from melted sea-ice cores and test their hypotheses by relating the observed sinking rates to variables such as EPS concentration in the ice. Changes in the contribution of the sea-ice community to different flux periods will be investigated using microscopy and DNA-based molecular techniques. Finally, to help explain the spatial variability in the EPS content of sea ice, they will quantify EPS production rates of cultured ice algae as a function of light level. This work is designed to provide a conceptual framework for understanding and predicting spatial and temporal variability in the sinking rates and nutritional quality of particles released from Arctic sea ice in relation to variables measured in the ice such as: snow depth, chlorophyll, particulate organic carbon, and EPS. The knowledge resulting from this study will contribute to our understanding of the Arctic Ocean carbon cycle and how it may be modified in response to climate variability.

Project Collaborative Research: Sonic Logging the NEEM Corehole, Greenland Metadata Principal Investigator: Edwin Waddington Description: Past deep ice cores recovered from the Greenland Ice Sheet have failed to obtain intact Eemian ice, ice from the last interglacial period. The recent NEEM effort has successfully recovered ~150 m of such ice. The proposed continuous sonic monitoring of the ice fabric will resolve small scale variability that is missed by the traditional techniques used in thin section analyses of ice cores, which tend to under-sample the core. The scales to be recovered with the sonic sampling are more comparable to those that can be observed with new gas-sampling technologies. The proposed work would add to the physical data set required to fully interpret data being recovered from the NEEM ice core, such as the gas content analyses used to infer past atmospheric conditions. The presence of a special USGS winch this summer, a winch required for the operation of University of Washington instrument proposed for deployment, and the planned abandonment of the NEEM field camp after the summer of 2012, make this proposal appropriate for a RAPID award.

Project COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Spatial and Temporal Influences of Thermokarst Failures on Surface Processes in Arctic Landscapes Metadata Principal Investigator: Ben Abbott Jeremy Jones Michelle Mack Collaborating Principal Investigator: Andrew Balser Samantha Miller Allison Woodward Description: Recent summaries of international research clearly document the past and future extent of climate warming in the Arctic. These summaries suggest that in the future, rising temperatures will be accompanied by increased precipitation, mostly as rain: 20% more over the Arctic as a whole and up to 30% more in coastal areas during the winter and autumn. These climate changes will have important impacts on Arctic Systems. Of direct interest to this research is the likelihood that warming will promote permafrost degradation and thaw. Formerly frozen soils may be further destabilized by increased precipitation, leading to hillslope thermokarst failures. Recent work has documented that thermokarst failures are abundant and appear to have become more numerous around Toolik Lake on the eastern North Slope and in the western Noatak River basin in Alaska. A widespread and long-term increase in the incidence of thermokarst failures may have important impacts on the structure and function of arctic headwater landscapes. This research will use a systems approach to address hypotheses about how thermokarst failures influence the structure and function of the arctic landscape. It will focus on the composition of vegetation, the distribution and processing of soil nutrients, and exports of sediments and nutrients to stream and lake ecosystems. Results obtained at this hillslope scale will be linked to patterns observed at the landscape scale to test hypotheses about the spatial distribution of thermokarst failures in the arctic foothills. It is important to understand these interactions because perhaps the greatest potential impacts of changing land surface processes and formation of thermokarst failures are feedbacks to the climate system through energy, albedo, water, and trace gas exchange. This research is designed to quantify linkages among climatology, hillslope hydrology, geomorphology, geocryology, community ecology of vegetation, soil nutrient dynamics, microbial ecology, trace gas dynamics, and aquatic ecology. It will employ a combination of field experimentation, remote sensing, and simulation modeling as a means to quantify these relationships.

The PIs propose to: (1) measure changes in the subglacial water system over the summer season using borehole water pressure transducers; (2) measure the ice sheet response to changes in basal conditions with surface-based GPS and measured rates of borehole deformation; (3) measure englacial and basal temperatures for input into flow models and to constrain estimates of ice deformation and; (4) correlate these data to melt and surface water volume proxies based on remote sensing data and meteorological data available from GC-Net and measured lake volume. The PIs intend to collaborate with Drs. Martin Funk and Martin Luthi, who have submitted a proposal to the Swiss Nation Science Foundation.

The two sites are nicknamed Gull and Foxx. Rogue Automated Weather Station Data Dataset These are Automated Weather Station data collected under the auspices of the ROGUE Project- Real-time Observations of Greenlands Under-ice Environment. The AWS measurements are mainly ancillary to the key measurements of the project, which were continuous surface velocity measurements using GPS, and borehole measurements of water pressure- both of these will be archived by the University of Texas ROGUE Borehole Televiewer data Dataset These data are borehole logs using an Optical Televiewer in a hot-water drilled borehole. The televiewer creates 360-degree 'unwrapped' image of the borehole wall as it descends through the hole. In addition to the image log, the televiewer also measured the inclination, azimuth, and temperature of the imaging head, as well as the strength of the magnetic field and gravity. For each log, there is thus a bmp file which is the image iteslf, and a csv file which is the ancillary information,...

Project Collaborative Research: Subglacial Water Intrusion in Greenland Metadata Principal Investigator: Gordon Oswald Description: A full understanding of the flow and dynamics of an ice sheet will require knowledge of the state of its subglacial interface. While the topography of the Greenland Ice Sheet bed has been studied by radio echo sounding, its state in terms of melting and freezing, which itself affects its future evolution, has been inferred from numerical models, rather than from direct evidence. This project is for analysis of existing radar echo data gathered under the PARCA and CReSIS programs, with the objective of generating direct evidence of the extent of subglacial water in Greenland and providing the glaciological community with maps of its extent. Previous echo analysis has found the variability of the received signal too great to extract the component due to variation of the bed material. Now, a method has been developed, validated and reported, based on further analysis of radio echo signal intensities, which allows the state of the bed to be determined reliably. This work will apply this method to all the available radio echo data, to generate maps of the extent of basal melting throughout Greenland. The procedure relies on a more precise assessment of radio echoes from the bed of the ice sheet than has previously been provided. It allows the variability of echo intensity to be reduced, and the variation of the bed material to be detected. It has been tested with data from a number of flights over Greenland during the 1999 field season, and is validated by tests of self-consistency, of echo intensity statistics, of interface smoothness, and of the relation between measured surface and interface slopes. The team will process data from flights undertaken between 1998 and 2005. Appropriate tests of self-consistency and statistical behavior will be applied. The presence or absence of water will be determined throughout. Results will be interpreted and maps compiled illustrating these results. The continuity and topographical context of each major water feature will be investigated and compared.

Project Collaborative Research: The Changing Seasonality of Tundra Nutrient Cycling: Implications for Ecosystem and Arctic System Functioning Metadata Principal Investigator: Michael Weintraub Patrick Sullivan Edward Rastetter Joshua Schimel Mathew Wallenstein Description: Arctic soils have large stores of carbon (C) and may act as a significant CO2 source with warming. However, the key to understanding tundra soil processes is nitrogen (N), as both plant growth and decomposition are severely N limited. However, current models of tundra ecosystems and their responses to climate change assume that while N limits plant growth, C limits decomposition. In addition, N availability is strongly seasonal with relatively high availability early in the growing season followed by a pronounced crash. There is a need to understand the controls on this seasonality to predict Arctic System responses to climate change, but there are multiple questions that need answers: 1) What causes the seasonal nutrient crash? 2) Does microbial activity switch seasonally between C and N limitation? 3) How will a lengthening of the growing season alter overall ecosystem C and N dynamics, as a result of differential extension of the periods before and after the nutrient crash? 4) What will be the larger impacts of these patterns on the Arctic system? Addressing these questions requires following plant and soil dynamics in a very tight time frame, coupling this understanding of the timing of C and N interactions to an enhanced mechanistic understanding of why the nutrient crash occurs, and then using transect sampling and ecosystem modeling to explore the large-scale implications of this seasonal crash. This proposed research will address our questions by: 1) Varying the length and timing of the growing season in the field by advancing snow melt and warming the ecosystem; 2) Establishing the fine scale seasonal time-courses of soil N availability, plant N content, leaf expansion, root growth and rhizodeposition, ecosystem respiration, microbial biomass and enzyme activity; 3) Conducting lab experiments to determine the extent to which microbial activity is limited by temperature, and C and N availability before and after the crash; 4) Determining how the timing of the nutrient crash and plant growth vary across a latitudinal transect; 5) Refining the Multiple Element Limitation model (MEL) that was developed for arctic ecosystems to better handle how plant and microbial systems respond to N limitation, and incorporating the specific drivers of the crash into MEL; 6) Testing the large-scale spatial and temporal effects of the seasonality of nutrient availability and how it may change in a warming Arctic with a lengthening growing season. This work will require intense mechanistic research focusing on transitions and transformations that occur over only a few weeks at most, but which have profound impacts on the tundra ecosystem. Researchers will scale this mechanistic work to the intermediate spatial scale by conducting transect measurements along a latitudinal transect to validate that patterns that occur locally are robust. They will scale to the whole Arctic system by integrating these mechanisms, and importantly, the N-effects on decomposition, into the MEL model that is designed to explore multiple limiting resource effects on ecosystem function. As an integrated package, this research will explore how the changing seasonal pattern that drives the crash in N availability in tundra soils will alter overall tundra C-cycling and its role as a source or sink of C and through this its role in the global climate system.

Project Collaborative Research: The impact of bromine chemistry on the isotopic composition of nitrate at Summit, Greenland Metadata Principal Investigator: Meredith Hastings Description: Nitrate is one of the major ions found in alpine and polar snow, yet it continues to be one of the least understood chemical components in ice core records. Recent work ahs shown nitrate isotope ratios to be a powerful tool for the study of nitrate in snow and ice cores. The isotopic composition of nitrate has been shown to contain information about the source of the nitrate (nitrogen oxides) and the oxidation processes that convert nitrogen oxides to nitrate in the atmosphere prior to deposition. Because hydroxyl and peroxy radicals have very different isotopic compositions than ozone, one can now distinguish the impact of the different oxidation processes that produce nitrate in the atmosphere. Seasonal observations of the oxygen isotopic composition of nitrate in snow at Summit, Greenland, cannot be understood in terms of standard, local photochemistry. The most likely causes of the model and observation discrepancy are that the box model lacks transport of nitrate from regions outside of Summit and the influence of halogen chemistry (i.e., BrO) on nitrate. Recent measurements suggest a higher than expected presence of BrO in the boundary layer above Summit. The aim of this project is to quantify the influence of bromine chemistry on nitrate production in the spring and summer. The approach includes field and laboratory measurements as well as modeling. During spring and summer field seasons, BrO and multiple gas-phase measurements will be conducted on-site, while isotopic analyses of snow and atmospheric samples will be completed in the laboratory. The oxygen isotopic composition of nitrate in snow and glacial ice holds potential for quantitatively reconstructing paleoatmospheric oxidant concentrations, but it is important to constrain how much this tracer reflects local versus regional or hemispheric scale chemistry. Furthermore, since BrO at Summit most likely originates from a natural source, and this source is affected by changes in climate, the influence of halogen chemistry on nitrogen oxides has important implications for the interpretation of recent and deep ice core records of nitrate.

Project Collaborative Research: The Impacts of Arctic Storms on Landfast Ice Variations Metadata Principal Investigator: Yanling Yu Description: This project is to examine a 30-year landfast ice records, cyclone tracks and intensity along with frequency and timing of coastal high wind conditions, nearshore pack ice drift, and coastal weather observations in two representative arctic coastal regions. The focus is to understand the relevant dynamic and thermodynamic processes that affect landfast ice variability in response to storm-produced coastal environmental change. To understand the physics that drive the dynamic and thermodynamic processes of landfast ice, existing coastal observations and numerical modeling will be included in a detailed process analysis. The principal investigators will merge their various data sets and knowledge to address the following questions: (1) How do changes in the storm climate affect the coastal air temperatures and wind conditions? (2) How does landfast ice, including its stability and grounding patterns, respond to coastal winds and storm activity as well as nearshore ice motion and coastal currents? (3) What are the physical connections among those factors determining long-term variations of fast ice extent and duration? (4) What impacts on landfast ice are likely under a scenario of increased storm activity? Landfast ice is a small fraction of the total ice cover of the Arctic Ocean, yet it is of extreme importance to the indigenous populations way of life. It protects the beach from erosion during extended periods of time; it provides a surface over which to travel between villages by snowmobile and sled; it is the surface from which much subsistence hunting (seal, walrus, whale) takes place. Understanding how it is and will change has importance for day-to-day safety, as well as strategic management.

Project Collaborative Research: The NEEM Deep Ice Core Metadata Principal Investigator: Ian Baker Edward Brook Jeff Severinghaus Todd Sowers CO Principal Investigator: Mary Albert Description: The North Eemian (NEEM) Deep Ice Core Project was designed to acquire a new ice core in northern Greenland. NEEM is an international effort, led by the glaciology group at the University of Copenhagen. More than a dozen countries have expressed a desire to participate. The US is a main partner in NEEM and is already providing about one-third of the logistics costs needed to collect the ice core. US scientists will take the lead on gas and gas isotope analyses and studies of the physics of gas incorporation into ice, they will place the modern climate in the context of the past two millennia, and they will help provide the basic temperature records in the ice needed to place all analyses in a climate context. A particular focus of the project will be on high temporal resolution to explore abrupt climate shifts. The most prominent analyses will focus on gas concentrations, in particular carbon monoxide, and stable isotopes of oxygen, hydrogen, argon, krypton, and carbon. A final subproject will focus on the firnification processes in order to understand the advection and diffusion of gases through the snow and ice and the development of ice bubbles that preserve the atmospheric gases.

This will allow the project scientists to make spatial and temporal comparisons to determine the impact of warmer temperatures, changing cloud cover and precipitation patterns, permafrost degradation, and direct human impacts on lakes; (2) Implement a multiscale (hierarchical) lake instrumentation scheme such that basic data is collected from 51 lakes, while a subset of lakes are more intensively instrumented; (3) Provide regional scaling and extrapolation of key metrics through calibration and validation of satellite imagery with ground measurements; and (4) Develop and implement standardized protocols to enable inter-site comparison and to prepare for expansion towards a pan-Arctic network. The education/outreach goals that address the broader impacts of the research outlined above are: (1) Incorporate indigenous observations of lake physical and biological characteristics and changes. Innovative interactive methods of sharing information will be developed and made available through native and local organizations. Scientific and technical training will be provided to Iñupiat students for monitoring lake and drinking water quality; (2) Develop a demonstration monitoring network based on the Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) architecture and link this network to research centers, indigenous communities, and other power- and connectivity-challenged environments; (3) Develop and refine data management, visualization, and archiving activities with ACADIS; and (4) Provide an introduction to Arctic science for several beginning investigators.

Project Collaborative Research: Terrestrial Linkages to Microbial and Metazoan Communities in Coastal Ecosystems of the Beaufort Sea Metadata Principal Investigator: Kenneth Dunton Byron Crump CO Principal Investigator: James McClelland Description: Coastal ecosystems of the Arctic receive extraordinarily large quantities of terrestrial organic matter through river discharge and shoreline erosion. The fate of this organic matter is of local interest as it relates to biological production in the coastal ocean. It is also of broader interest with respect to global biogeochemical cycling. The prevailing paradigm is that terrestrial organic matter inputs to the Arctic Ocean are highly recalcitrant. However, most studies supporting this paradigm have been conducted during mid- to late- summer. This effort is based on the premise that terrestrial organic matter, in both dissolved and particulate form, provides an important carbon and energy subsidy that supports and maintains heterotrophic activity and food webs in coastal waters during much of the year. The work will focus on a set of 12 field sites along the Alaskan Beaufort Sea coast, in the vicinity of Barter Island and the Inupiaq village of Kaktovik. Comparisons among sites ranging from lagoons to open coastal systems that receive differing amounts of freshwater runoff and also differ markedly in their exchange characteristics with shelf waters will be used to examine linkages between biological communities and organic matter inputs from land. Examining these linkages will help determine how seasonally distinct terrestrial inputs of water and organic matter influence microbial and metazoan communities in coastal waters of the Alaskan Beaufort Sea. Researchers will address this question thorough a seasonally explicit sampling program that includes field trips during the 9-month ice covered period as well as summer. Measurements of water and sediment chemistry, benthic and water column community characteristics, and natural abundance isotopic tracers will be used to evaluate the importance of terrestrial inputs under different hydrologic/hydrographic conditions. Understanding the fate of terrestrial carbon in arctic coastal waters is especially important now, as the arctic system enters a period of rapid climatic change. Changes in terrestrial organic matter export could influence total production as well as the relative roles of autotrophy and heterotrophy in arctic coastal waters. Such shifts have consequences for local human populations that use coastal food webs for subsistence and for the broad scientific community interested in land-sea coupling. This work focuses on fundamental questions about the fate of terrestrial organic matter in arctic coastal waters that must be answered before we can effectively consider future changes in land-sea coupling in the Arctic. This collaborative project will support the dissertation research of two graduate students and two post-doctoral associates and also continue a very successful K-12 outreach program, entitled ?Climate Change in the Arctic: An Interactive Program Linking Scientists with K-12 Students? that includes the establishment of a summer field science program for native Kaktovik K-12 students. The Village Council has expressed keen enthusiasm to involve middle school students in hands-on science activities that can be provided in conjunction with teachers from the Kaktovik school district.

Project Collaborative Research: An Arctic Ocean Sea Surface pCO2 and pH Observing Network Metadata Principal Investigator: Mike DeGrandpre CO Principal Investigator: Rick Krishfield John Toole Description: The goal of the proposed study is to establish an Arctic Observing Network (AON) for sea surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) and pH in the perennially ice-covered portion of the Arctic Ocean. The carbon cycle is of particular concern in the Arctic because it is unknown how carbon sources and sinks will change in response to warming and the reduction of summer sea ice cover, and whether these changes will lead to increased greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere. Furthermore, the penetration of anthropogenic CO2 into the Arctic Ocean is leading to acidification with potentially serious consequences for organisms. Little is known about pCO2 and the inorganic carbon cycle in the central Arctic Ocean because most measurement programs to date have focused on the Arctic shelves during the accessible summer period. The investigators propose to use an existing component of the Arctic Observing Network, the Ice-Tethered Profilers (ITP), as platforms for deployment of in situ pCO2 and pH sensors. ITPs are automated profiling systems distributed throughout the perennial Arctic ice pack that telemeter data back to shore: 44 ITPs have been deployed since 2004 and the project is currently slated to continue through 2013. In the proposed work, a total of 6 ITPs will be equipped with CO2 sensors and four of these will also have pH sensors. The sensors will be fixed on the ITP cable ~2-4 m below the ice. Each unit will include additional sensors for dissolved O2, salinity, and photosynthetically available radiation (and in some cases chlorophyll-a fluorescence) and will be capable of making 12 measurements per day for at least one year. These data, available in near real-time on the ITP web site (www.whoi.edu/itp/), will lead to a better understanding of the Arctic Ocean's role in regulating greenhouse gases and how the ecology of the Arctic will change with warming and acidification. The investigators will also engage in outreach programs including public presentations, podcasts, and school visits. A portion of the budget is also dedicated to the development of a climate-change/ocean acidification exhibit to be displayed in the University of Montana?s science museum. The exhibit will reside at the museum for three months, then visit over 15 rural and tribal communities annually over a three year period. Undergraduate students will be recruited to assist with the sensor testing and data analysis, gaining a higher level of technical knowledge than possible through a traditional degree program.

Project AMTS: Arctic Mesopause Temperature Study Metadata Description: The Arctic Mesopause Temperature Study (AMTS) targeted the coldest part of the earths atmosphere: the mesopause, about 85 kilometers (53 miles) above the North Pole in summer. The cold is caused by an upwelling of air over the polar caps, says principal investigator Chester Gardner (University of Illinois, UI). Before AMTS, the highest altitude at which polar temperatures had been measured was about 30 km, using balloons. To sample the mesopause, Gardner collaborated with George Papen (UI), Jerry Gelbwachs (The Aerospace Corporation), and RAF to develop and deploy a new instrument, the Iron Boltzmann Lidar. It takes advantage of a layer of atomic iron in the mesosphere, the residue of meteors that burned up in this region. Iron absorbs light and re-emits it at certain wavelengths, giving a bright backscatter signal. The lasers in the lidar are tuned to two of those wavelengths. As the laser light passes through the iron layer, the resulting glow is detected by the lidars two telescopes.

Project BARROW: The Barrow Project Metadata Description: The U.S. Arctic remains one of the most difficult places on Earth for year-round scientific observations and research. Logistical support is very expensive, and scientists frequently face dangerous, cold sea-ice dynamics, aircraft icing, and even polar bears. While satellites can obtain data in remote regions, their application to many arctic environmental problems is hampered by persistent cloudiness and the complexity of the underlying snow/ice surface. One of the major recommendations of the 1997 report, quot;Logistics Recommendations for an Improved U.S. Arctic Research Capabilityquot; (www.arcus.org/logistics/index.html), was to increase use of robotic aircraft to meet the growing need for environmental observing in the region. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) excel in quot;dull, dirty, dangerousquot; missions. The National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs funded a project to establish a facility in Barrow, Alaska, adapt the Aerosonde to extreme arctic conditions, adapt and integrate miniature instrumentation, and assimilate Aerosonde data into predictive models. The EOL holdings for this project consist of NCAR/PSU MM5 model forecast plots for April, May, and Sept 2002 in support of Aerosonde UAV flights.

Project BSIERP: Bering Sea Integrated Ecosystem Research Program Metadata Description: The Bering Sea Integrated Ecosystem Research Program (BSIERP) offers a system of vertically integrated hypotheses and the means to test them. The hypotheses explain how climate controls the time and place of production of upper trophic level species. Specific testable hypotheses are addressed through retrospective analyses, three years of new observations, full use of existing observations and modeling of climate and ecosystems. Models predict the likelihoods of population levels, trends and other attributes under several climate scenarios. Under warming or cooling, bottom-up control processes (water temperatures, sea ice extent and duration, strength and location of ocean currents and nutrient fluxes) determine the time and place of food production. Under warming, changes in time and place of food production lead to dominance of top-down control processes in the pelagic marine environment and the decline of benthic production, whereas cooling relaxes top-down control in the pelagic zone and increases benthic production. The BSIERP project focuses on understanding trophic interactions among: 1) colony-based foragers, 2) hot spot foragers, 3) pelagic forage species, 4) pelagic predators and 5) benthic predators. Hypotheses are tested in a linked set of spatially explicit, competing models that connect climate scenarios, physical and biological oceanographic models, a lower and upper trophic level ecosystem model and economic and management models. Models forecast changes in abundance of pelagic piscivores in response to changes in predators and prey and attendant economic and management consequences. Two-way connections between the program and communities, stakeholders and the regions body of local and traditional knowledge are enabled by outreach, education and community involvement projects. Products of the project enable testing and improved understanding of effects of climate change and management actions on the Bering Sea ecosystem. BSIERP is administered by the North Pacific Research Board (NPRB), Anchorage, Alaska.

Project Collaborative Research: An investigation of wave dynamics in the Arctic mesosphere and coupling between the lower and upper polar atmosphere Metadata Principal Investigator: Kim Nielsen Description: The research objective is to utilize a suite of instruments, including an airglow imager, to investigate short-period gravity waves in the Arctic atmosphere over Alaska. Short-period gravity waves are an important component of the larger atmospheric circulation as these waves are believed to transport a large amount of vertical moment flux into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region. While the propagation nature and sources of these waves have been studied extensively at low- and mid-latitudes, little is known about their behavior at high latitudes. Recent efforts have begun to characterize the waves over the Antarctic continent, while the project proposed here will focus on the Arctic. Specifically, the proposed research will establish a long-term winter time series of short-period gravity waves in the Arctic, including their dominant source regions, and influences of large-scale tidal and planetary wave motion. The co-located Rayleigh LIDAR will provide essential high vertical resolution temperature measurements to help elucidate the vertical wave propagation, individual wave contribution to the Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux, and coupling between the lower and upper atmosphere during stratospheric warming events.

Project Collaborative Research: Forty-Thousand Years of Yedoma: An investigation into the spatial heterogeneity and paleo-history of organic-rich permafrost in Alaska Metadata Principal Investigator: Yuri Shur Matthew Sturm CO Principal Investigator: James Beget Nancy Bigelow Mikhail Kanevskiy Thomas Douglas Kevin Bjella Description: NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT for Collaborative Research: Forty-Thousand Years of Yedoma (ARC 1107571) An investigation into the spatial heterogeneity and paleo-history of organic-rich permafrost in Alaska A new permafrost tunnel 4 m high and 30 m long was excavated near Fox, Alaska in 2011. It is adjacent to the older and widely known CRREL tunnel. The new tunnel penetrates yedoma (loess or silt) deposits ranging from modern to more than 40,000 years old. Beautifully exposed in the walls of the tunnel are a series of ice wedges, thermokarst-cave ice, and paleosols that record the climatic and ecological history of central Alaska since the last Ice Age. We propose to map and sample these sediments using a variety of analysis techniques, including extensive AMS radiocarbon dating to reveal environmental conditions during the yedoma formation. We will use the results to reconstruct the paleo-climatic and environmental history of the central Alaska region, a region that during the past 40,000 years has been cold enough to produce and support permafrost, but where now permafrost is thawing. The expected results will not only tell us about how climate has varied in Alaska during this critical period, but also in the other yedoma regions of the world which include Siberia and Canada. The new tunnel will be used as a classroom for students in geology and environmental engineering.

Dataset Carbon, Water, and Energy Balance of the Arctic Landscape at Flagship Observatories and in a Pan-Arctic Network   Imnaviat Creek Alaska - Ridge Station IC 1991 Consolidated Dataset Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: Colin Edgar Description: The Ridge and the Fen sites at Imnaviat creek are identical and support identical sensor suites. The heart of each system is an open-path eddy covariance system that measures the fluxes of carbon dioxide, water vapour and energy. In addition to this, each system measures standard meteorological and subsurface variables such as wind speed, air temperature and soil energy fluxes. The majority of these sensors were supplied by Campbell Scientific, Inc. The CSAT3 and the LI7500 form the core of the eddy covariance (EC) system and are used to measure high frequency fluctuations of the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O) and vertical wind speed in order to determine fugacity of carbon dioxide (FCO2), latent heat (Qe), and sensible heat (Qh). Additionally, wind direction is determined by using the two horizontal measurements of wind speed from the CSAT3. The EC systems are positioned at heights of 3.18m and 2.20m at the Ridge and Fen sites respectively. The LI7500s are positioned 150 degrees behind each CSAT3 at a distance of 15cm and are oriented 30 degrees from vertical to reduce snow/ice/rain accumulation on the lenses. This results in an estimated measurement rejection angle of 30 degrees directly behind each EC system. At each station, the EC systems are oriented 150 degrees from true north into the dominant yearly wind direction in order to maximize the probability that measurements will be taken outside of the instrument rejection angle. Accordingly, the Renewable Energy Plants are located 30m away and in the centre of the measurement rejection zone. The other basic meteorological instruments such as the albedometer, the net radiometer, the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) sensor, the Sonic Ranger, the tipping bucket rain gauge and the soil heat flux instruments are necessary to complete our measurements of the components of the energy balance in order to evaluate the performance of the EC system with an energy balance closure calculation and assist us with the quality control of the resultant dataset. Additionally, they assist in the evaluation of the impact of fundamental forcing factors on the observed mass and energy fluxes. Massman, W.J.

Project Core Measurements at Summit, Greenland Environmental Observatory Metadata Principal Investigator: Roger Bales Description: This 5-year project supports continuing and expanding the collection of long-term measurements of the Arctic atmosphere, snow and other Earth system components at the Summit Greenland Environmental Observatory (GEOSummit), located at an elevation of 3100 m on the Greenland ice sheet. A core suite of measurements has been collected at GEOSummit since 1993 and this project provides for the continued operation of GEOSummit as long-term site for year-round disciplinary and interdisciplinary measurements and research. The location provides a compliment to lower-elevation sites and a Northern Hemisphere analog to South Pole station. Measurements include baseline meteorology, radiation, tropospheric chemistry, snow properties and snow chemistry, some measurements in cooperation with NOAA-CMDL and measurements initiated by individual investigators. Measurements are aligned with the objectives of the World Meteorological Organization's Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) program. The atmospheric gas-phase and aerosol species being studied are all either sensitive indicators of anthropogenic impacts on regional and global atmospheric change, or are important chemically coupled species whose concentrations may be strongly influenced by changes in the Arctic, including changes in snow/ice surface temperatures, ice/snow cover, and atmospheric circulation. Related chemical measurements in the snow provide the needed link to investigate feedbacks between Arctic climate change, air-snow exchange, and atmospheric composition. Recent evidence indicates that important atmospheric chemical constituents undergo temperature-dependent exchange with ice/snow, and that some species are photochemically transformed and/or produced within the sunlit surface snowpack. Understanding arctic environmental change requires a quantitative understanding of the environmental controls (e.g., temperature, radiation, humidity, ozone concentration) on air-snow feedbacks, as well as the impact of these processes on the entire Arctic atmosphere. Because changes in Arctic atmospheric circulation are cyclic over 4-5 year or longer times, long-duration measurements are needed to understand circulation and to place observed changes in a long-term perspective. Data and results will be shared via the National Snow and Ice Data Center data archive.

Project RUI: Collaborative Research: Fire regime influences on carbon dynamics of Siberian boreal forests Metadata Principal Investigator: Michael Loranty Heather Alexander Description: Boreal forests cover 40% of the vegetated land area above the Arctic Circle and are a critical component of arctic ecosystems. Global change models predict boreal forests will become increasingly susceptible to fire activity with climate warming. Because these forests contain a large proportion of global terrestrial carbon (C) stocks, changes in the fire regime are likely to alter global C cycling. Increased fire activity will increase C emissions to the atmosphere, with a potential positive feedback to climate warming. However, an altered fire regime may also initiate cascading effects on forest regrowth and permafrost degradation that could magnify or offset this feedback. Fire effects on these ecological mechanisms remain uncertain but will ultimately determine whether arctic ecosystems act as a C source or sink under future climate change scenarios. The primary objective of this research is to increase our understanding of post-fire C dynamics in boreal forests of the Siberian arctic by elucidating the ecological mechanisms by which increased fire severity could influence C accumulation and storage over the successional interval. The overarching hypothesis is that post-fire soil organic layer (SOL) depth regulates net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) through indirect impacts on forest regrowth and permafrost stability because of its role as a barrier to seed germination and thermal regulator. The team will: 1) link near term fire effects on SOL depth to changes in larch recruitment and permafrost characteristics in experimental burn plots created in 2012, 2) determine the relationship between post-fire stand structure and above- and belowground C pools at the local and landscape level across stands of varying age and topographic positions, and 3) test via experimental manipulations and field observations the mechanisms by which fire-driven changes in stand density indirectly affect moss growth, SOL development, and susceptibility of deeper C pools to warming, decomposition, and release into the atmosphere. This research will offer novel insights into the importance of both vegetation and soil processes within arctic ecosystems in determining the net feedback of an intensified fire regime to the climate system. Intellectual Merit: Larch forests of the Siberian arctic comprise 20% of all boreal forest ecosystems and are distinct from other boreal forests in that they consist of a single tree genus (Larix spp.) with a deciduous growth habit and often grow on continuous, C-rich ?yedoma? permafrost. Thus, their response to warming climate and an altered fire regime is likely to differ from boreal forests in other regions. Uncertainties regarding current C pools in Siberian boreal forests remain a significant factor affecting our ability to predict climate-induced changes to the global C cycle. The proposed study will contribute to our understanding of how arctic forest fires impact global C cycling and provide essential data necessary for scaling-up arctic C pools, estimating C emissions from arctic fires, and calibrating predictive models of future global C cycling. Broader Impacts: This project will result in the training of undergraduate and graduate students from two predominantly undergraduate institutions and one Hispanic-Serving Institution. The PI and her students will develop outreach activities with local K-12 schools in south Texas to help teachers create lesson plans involving arctic science, boreal ecology, and climate change and involve researcher presentations to science classrooms to provide real-life examples of arctic research and expose K-12 students to different career and educational paths in the sciences.

Project Ultraviolet Radiation in the Arctic: 2012-2015 Metadata Principal Investigator: Germar Bernhard John Frederick Description: In 1987, responding to serious ozone depletion reported in Antarctica, the National Science Foundation established a network of instruments to observe solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation at high latitudes. The network eventually grew to seven sites including two Arctic locations at Barrow, Alaska (71° 19’ N), and Summit, Greenland (72° 34’ N). Data available through ACADIS include measurements of UV radiation and related data products from Barrow starting in 1991 and from Summit starting in 2004. Effective 1-August 2009, the two sites were integrated into NSF’s Arctic Observing Network as part of the NSF AON projects “Ultraviolet Radiation in the Arctic” and, since 2012, “Ultraviolet Radiation in the Arctic: 2012-2015.” Data include spectra of solar spectral irradiance between 280 and 600 nm, biologically effective dose-rates, total ozone, surface albedo, and cloud optical depth. The long time-series provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of a changing environment on UV radiation. Measurements at Summit are ideally suited to probe the free troposphere and study the effects of long-range transport of pollutants and aerosols on UV radiation. Data can also be used for validation of satellite observations, verification of models describing the transfer of radiation through the atmosphere, advancement of climate models, and addressing the SEARCH question whether the Arctic is moving to a new state. Data of this project are part of the preceding project "Ultraviolet Radiation in the Arctic".

Dataset Collaborative Research: Greenland Meltwater Geomicrobiology   Diversity and abundance of microbial assemblages in glacial meltwaters at the western margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet Metadata Download Data Description: Microbial processes that mineralize organic carbon and enhance solute production at the bed of polar ice sheets could be of a magnitude sufficient to affect global elemental cycles. To investigate the biogeochemistry of polar glacial meltwater microbial ecosystems, we analyzed water discharged during the summer of 2011, 2012 and 2013 from 1) North River, which flows through the Pituffik region of the Thule Basin (2011, 2013) and 2) Russell Glacier, a land-terminating outlet glacier near Kangerlussuaq (2012, 2013) both at the western margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The structure and diversity of microbial assemblages was investigated through high throughput sequence analysis of the small subunit (16S or 18S) rRNA genes. Microbial abundances of total and active microbes were determined by epifluorescence microscopy using the DNA stains DAPI and Acridine Orange and the electron transport system stain CTC.

Dataset Collaborative Research: Development of an Ice-Tethered Winch for the Seasonal Ice Zone   CTD and Optical Data from the Ice-Tethered Winch Deployment Trial Spring 2014 Metadata Download Data CO Principal Investigator: Emily Shroyer Richard Krishfield Description: These data were collected as part of a development project that merged two existing technologies: the ice-tethered profiler and the arctic winch. The new platform, the ice-tethered winch, combines the capabilities of these two platforms, providing near real-time data, similar to the ice-tethered profiler, but capable of profiling over the variable topography of the shelf (arctic winch). The surface package for the ITW is based on that of the ITP with Iridium, GPS, electronics, and power for communications, and buoyancy sufficient to float the system in open water. The lowered package is based on the Arctic Winch and includes the electronics, power, and hardware for a sub-surface winch and winch controller along with an instrumentation package that is repeatedly lowered and raised from its docking station beneath the ice to the bottom or 50-m depth, whichever is less. Sensors measure conductivity, temperature, pressure, fluorescence, and turbidity. Year two of the project included finalization of the design, manufacture of the systems and field-testing. In spring 2014, two ITWs were temporarily deployed offshore of Barrow, AK as part of the testing phase of the system.. ITW1 was deployed at 71.3956N, 156.4879W and ITW2 was deployed at 71.3961N, 156.4882W. The deployment spanned April 2014. The CTD and optical (fluorescence and turbidity) data from this test period in shallow water (~5-m depth) are available here and from the ITP website (www.whoi.edu/itp/itw1data.html, www.whoi.edu/itp/itw2data.html).

Title: McKay 2005 Characterization of Climatic Influences on Modern Sedimentation in an Arctic Lake, Svalbard, Norway Description: Abstract: Modern sedimentation in Lake Linné was studied as part of the NSF-funded Svalbard REU Project to calibrate the lamination stratigraphy in the glacier-fed lake. Lake Linné, located on the west coast of Spitsbergen, receives melt water from the Linné glacier, located 8 km up valley. The focus of the investigation is to better understand climatic effects on yearly sedimentation, and to better characterize annual variation in the sediment record. Sediment traps were deployed at five sites (each site having traps at varying depths), from July 2003 to August 2004, in order to facilitate spatial and temporal understanding of sedimentation occurring in the lake. The collected sediment was sub-sampled and analyzed using a Coulter LS230 Particle Analyzer in order to characterize textural changes both temporally in each trap, as well as spatially throughout the lake. Sedimentation rates calculated from the recovered yearlong sediment traps ranged from 277 to 28 mg/cm2/yr (1.5 to 0.15 mm/yr) from the most proximal to distal sites respectively. These sedimentation rates compare well to calculated average rates of sedimentation based on thickness of lacustrine sediment in the lake. Changes in grain size recorded in the sediment traps throughout the year demonstrate a strong peak in grain size associated with a spring melt event. These melt-out deposits are substantially coarser (median grain size = 53 µm) than any other sediment deposited during the year, including deposits associated with a high precipitation and discharge event (median grain size &lt; 16 µm). This suggests that the spring melt sediment is deposited by different mechanism, most likely overland flow during the spring melt. Weather events (rain and solar insolation) affected the grain size of sediment deposited proximally in the lake; median grain size is strongly correlated to discharge from the inlet stream in the late summer.

Title: Nussbaum 2013 A Temporal Analysis of Suspended Sediment Concentration Changes in A Proglacial Meltwater Stream, Linnébreen, Svalbard Description: Abstract: Data suggest that climate change has significantly affected and will continue to affect global environments. Furthermore, research suggests that the current warming trend will continue, and it is therefore important to study current environmental systems in order to understand the complicated dynamics of warming and response (Parry, Canziani, Palutikof, van der Linden, &amp; Hanson, 2007). Arctic environments are particularly sensitive to climate change, and are therefore a critical area to study (Svendsen &amp; Mangerud, 1997). The purpose of this paper is to investigate water discharge and suspended sediment flux patterns in a proglacial meltwater stream flowing from the Linnébreen glacier in Spitsbergen, Svalbard, and to characterize sediment storage in the proglacial system. Changes in suspended sediment concentration (SSC) act as sensitive indicators of interactions between the glacier, climate, and landscape (Strzelecki, 2009). This work uses statistical methods to provide a framework with which to qualitatively describe subseasonal forcings behind discharge and SSC changes in the proglacial meltwater stream. Precipitation is found to be a primary forcer of both discharge and suspended sediment concentration changes. Furthermore, a subseasonal split was determined midway through the monitoring period, described by lessening lag times between discharge peaks and SSC peaks, and indicating a continued maturation of the entire system. Continued research of this nature will contribute to the ongoing effort to characterize the dynamics of the Linnébreen basin and to continuing research on Arctic glacier responses to the effects of climate change.

Title: Pendleton 2011 The Glaciofluvial Environment of Linnébreen, Spitsbergen, Svalbard Description: Abstract: Suspended sediment concentrations (SSC), meltwater discharge and local climatic conditions of the Linné glaciofluvial system were monitored from July 21 to August 9, 2010 in order to determine the temporal relationships between local climate, glacier melting and sediment production. ISCO water samplers were installed along the main meltwater channel to record SSC. SSC was directly related to discharge of the glaciofluvial system, which was in turn dependent on melt of the Linné glacier. The relationship between SSC and climatic conditions can be linked to the rate of glacier melt, which is in turn controlled by local climatic conditions. Of all the observed weather conditions, precipitation had the highest impact on glacier melt and discharge and therefore had the highest correlation to SSC. During periods without precipitation, solar radiation was the greatest influence on glacier melt and SSC. Measured SSC and calculated sediment load for the season from the Lower (distal) site was substantially less than the measured SSC and calculated sediment load at the Upper (proximal) site. The differences between the two sampling sites indicate that the glaciofluvial system immediately downvalley of the glacier is acting as a sediment sink. This study has established that increased SSC is largely due to increased precipitation. The presence of a pro-glacial sediment sink interrupts the sediment signal produced by the glacier and complicates the sediment record down valley in Lake Linné.

Dataset Collaborative Research: Toward a Circumarctic Lakes Observation Network (CALON)-- Multiscale observations of lacustrine systems   Field surveys - Light transparency and water temperature profiles, August 2013 (CALON) Metadata Download Data Description: Data include raw downwelling irradiance against depth, attenuation coefficients (Kd), and 1% and 10% attenuation depths in meters for 305 nm, 320 nm, and 380 nm ultraviolet light as well as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 400-700 nm). BIC units for UV irradiance are in mW cm-2 nm-1, which can be converted to the SI unit mW m-2 by multiplying BIC values by 10. BIC units for PAR irradiance are mmol m-2 sec-1. The attenuation coefficients are calculated using the following relationship: Kd = ln(Io/Iz) / Z where Io and Iz represent the light intensities at an upper and lower depth separated by a depth of Z meters. The 1% and 10% attenuation depths are calculated based upon the Kd value for each wavelength. Note that if the water is highly transparent the calculated 1% and 10% depths can exceed the depth of the lake. Temperature readings for each depth are also made during each profile. The top of the thermocline is estimated as the point where the water temperature drops at least 1 degree Celsius in 1 m. Progress: Completed - Dataset fully collected/analyzed.

Dataset Arctic Great Rivers Observatory   Arctic Great Rivers Observatory I and II Data Metadata Download Data Principal Investigator: Robert Max Holmes James McClelland Peter Raymond Robert Spencer Point of Contact: Suzanne Tank Description: The PARTNERS and Arctic-GRO projects sample the biogeochemistry of the six largest rivers draining to the Arctic Ocean. To the greatest extent possible, sample collection techniques are identical across rivers. Once collected, samples are returned to Woods Hole, MA, from where they are shipped to expert laboratories for analyses. Sample collection is as follows: PARTNERS Project (2002-2006): The PARTNERS sampling protocol was modeled on the USGS equal discharge increment sampling protocol. Five depth-integrated samples were collected across the river channel on each sampling date using a USGS D-96 depth-integrating sampler fitted with a Teflon nozzle and Teflon collecting bag. The samples were combined in a 14-L Teflon churn to form a composite sample to account for within-river vertical and horizontal heterogeneity. Under-ice samples were collected near the water surface, from a single, mid-channel hole in the ice. The Arctic Great Rivers Observatory (Arctic-GRO) Project (2009-2011): The Arctic-GRO sampling protocol followed the PARTNERS protocol. On each river, samples were collected five times per year: three during the freshet, one during late summer, and one under ice. In addition to this "comprehensive" collection of data five times per year, samples were also collected daily during the freshet and analysed for a subset of constituents. The daily freshet samples were collected from directly beneath the water surface using a polycarbonate collection bottle. The Arctic Great Rivers Observatory II (Arctic-GRO II) Project (2012-2016): The Arctic GRO II project collects targeted 'surface' and 'deep' samples. Samples are collected bi-monthly (every two months). During open water conditions, surface samples are collected from immediately below the water surface from three points across the river channel and composited. Under ice, surface samples are collected from a single, mid-channel hole in the ice. Deep sample collection began in summer, 2013. Deep samples are collected mid-channel, from a recorded depth.

Dataset Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring Network--CALM III   CALM III update June 5, 2012 Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: Nikolay Shiklomanov Dmitry Streletskiy Description: This archive contains all Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) data submitted prior to June 5, 2012. The active-layer network of about 200 sites represents the only coordinated and standardized program of observations using standard measurement protocols designed to observe and detect decadal changes in the dynamics of seasonal thawing and freezing in high-latitude soils. The Intellectual Merit of this study lies in the need for long-term time series of active layer depth, ground temperature, and thaw settlement measurements at the same locations and across diverse terrain types and regions in order to identify scales of spatial variation, establish trends, and validate models.

Dataset Cloud Properties Across the Arctic Basin from Surface and Satellite Measurements - An existing Arctic Observing Network   Cloud microphysical properties at Arctic atmospheric observatories Metadata Point of Contact: Matthew Shupe Description: Cloud microphysical properties determine the manner in which clouds impact atmospheric radiation and the hydrological cycle. This collection of data sets documents vertically-resolved cloud microphysical properties at multiple locations across the Arctic. Observations are based on the available surface-based, remote-sensors measurements at each site. A variety of cloud microphysics retrieval algorithms are employed to first identify the cloud type (phase) and then characterize the hydrometeor characteristic size and water content for both liquid and ice phases. While an attempt has been made to maintain consistent retrievals across the different observatories, each has a unique set of cloud observation instruments which can impose unique, site-specific signatures on the retrieval results.

Dataset Annual Observations of the Biological and Physical Marine Environment in the Chukchi and Nearshore Beaufort Seas near Barrow, AK   CTD Data 2010 Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: Carin Ashjian Stephen Okkonen Description: This data set contains the raw .hex files and the .cnv from conductivity temperature depth (CTD) casts conducted near Barrow, AK from August 21 - September 8, 2010. Details of the latitude, longitude, date, and time are listed in the event log that is archived at this site. Date, time, position, bottom depth, and project sample line also are listed in each file. Each CTD file is named sequentially; corresponding station numbers are listed in the event log. No CTD data were recorded at stations 45 and 46 because of battery failure so CTD files 45 and 46 are missing from the sequence. Data were collected from the research vessel R/V Annika Marie using a SeaBird (SBE) 19+ CTD sensor equipped with a Wetlabs WetStar WS3S fluorometer and Biospherical Instrument Inc. Model QSP2300 PAR/irradiance sensor sensor. No post-processing of the data was done. Fluorescence is reported as mg/m3 chlorophyll a, with conversion from volts according to factory calibrations. These values were ground-truthed to extracted chlorophyll from samples collected using Niskin bottles. The reported chlorophyll a values in the CTD files need to be corrected according to the equation: Y=0.1334X +0.1437 Where X is the value from the WetLabs Fluorometer and Y is the corrected value in mg/m3. The files have been zipped into two files for ease. The .con file used by SeaSoft also is included and is zipped into each of the files. Progress: Completed - Dataset fully collected/analyzed.

Dataset Factors Controlling Seasonal Changes in the Structure and Function of Food Webs of Perennial Spring Streams in Arctic Alaska   Ecosystem metabolism for an arctic warm spring-stream (Ivishak Hot Spring, Alaska) Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: Alexander Huryn Description: We investigated the productivity of a perennial, Arctic spring-stream. Ivishak Spring has the stable discharge (~131 L/s) and temperature (~4-8 degrees Celsius) typical for springs. It is unusual, however, in having an annual cycle of daylight from 24 hrs/d (summer) to 0 hrs/d (winter). We tested the hypothesis that stored detritus would buffer carbon limitation during winter when gross primary production (GPP) is minimized, resulting in constant rates of community respiration (CR) year-round due to constant temperatures. We used open-channel methods to measure GPP and CR monthly from March 2007 to August 2009. Mean annual GPP was 458 gC/m2. Such a level is typical for temperate desert-streams but was surprising for an Arctic stream. Annual CR (887 gC/m2) was also remarkable. The high metabolism of this stream is explained by an open canopy, moderate year round temperatures, stable bed, and high bryophyte biomass (48 gAFDM/m2). Strong seasonal cycles of GPP were mirrored by CR (r=0.65) indicating the possibility of carbon limitation during winter. This result falsified our hypothesis that CR would be relatively stable year-round due to a detritus buffer and constant temperature. README: Consult the data set README for more information about the physical location of the measurement, instrument description, data collection and processing, data remarks, and data formats. Location Information: Ivishak spring is a tributary of the Ivishak River, a braided river that flows through the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) on the North Slope of the Brooks Range, Alaska.

Title: Imnaviat Creek Alaska - Ridge Station IC 1991 Consolidated Dataset Description: The Ridge and the Fen sites at Imnaviat creek are identical and support identical sensor suites. The heart of each system is an open-path eddy covariance system that measures the fluxes of carbon dioxide, water vapour and energy. In addition to this, each system measures standard meteorological and subsurface variables such as wind speed, air temperature and soil energy fluxes. The majority of these sensors were supplied by Campbell Scientific, Inc. The CSAT3 and the LI7500 form the core of the eddy covariance (EC) system and are used to measure high frequency fluctuations of the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O) and vertical wind speed in order to determine fugacity of carbon dioxide (FCO2), latent heat (Qe), and sensible heat (Qh). Additionally, wind direction is determined by using the two horizontal measurements of wind speed from the CSAT3. The EC systems are positioned at heights of 3.18m and 2.20m at the Ridge and Fen sites respectively. The LI7500s are positioned 150 degrees behind each CSAT3 at a distance of 15cm and are oriented 30 degrees from vertical to reduce snow/ice/rain accumulation on the lenses. This results in an estimated measurement rejection angle of 30 degrees directly behind each EC system. At each station, the EC systems are oriented 150 degrees from true north into the dominant yearly wind direction in order to maximize the probability that measurements will be taken outside of the instrument rejection angle. Accordingly, the Renewable Energy Plants are located 30m away and in the centre of the measurement rejection zone. The other basic meteorological instruments such as the albedometer, the net radiometer, the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) sensor, the Sonic Ranger, the tipping bucket rain gauge and the soil heat flux instruments are necessary to complete our measurements of the components of the energy balance in order to evaluate the performance of the EC system with an energy balance closure calculation and assist us with the quality control of the resultant dataset. Additionally, they assist in the evaluation of the impact of fundamental forcing factors on the observed mass and energy fluxes. Massman, W.J.

Metadata Principal Investigator: Jack Kruse Collaborating Principal Investigator: Lawrence Hamilton Description: This collaboration of Kruse, University of Alaska, Anchorage (0638408, LEAD) and Hamilton, University of New Hampshire (0638413) is part of the Arctic Observation Network (AON), initiated as part of the International Polar Year, and will implement phase one human dimension priorities of the Study of Arctic Environmental Change (SEARCH) program. This Human Dimension Observation System is designed to become part of a network of measurement systems developed within SEARCH. The goal of the researchers is to understand how socio-economic systems respond to rapid environmental change, and how local response interacts with broad forces of development and government policies to affect the well-being of Arctic residents. They will integrate existing data for key variables identified by the Committee: population size and structure, births, deaths, migration, health measures, cultural diversity, education, and economic indicators, including employment, subsistence, and government structure. For this study, they have identified stakeholder groups in each of the "arenas of climate-human interaction" (i.e., marine mammal hunting, fisheries, resource development) and have formed an advisory group made up of representatives of the following indigenous organizations: RAIPON, Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, Saami Council, Maniilaq, North Slope Borough, Makivik Corp., and the Labrador Inuit Association. The project will focus on four arenas likely to involve climate-human interactions: marine mammal hunting; oil, gas, and mineral development; tourism; and fisheries. A fifth project focus is on indicators of social outcomes of human interactions with environmental change. As part of AON, the project is designed to foster integrated analysis across the physical, natural, and social sciences. Progress: Not Assigned - Dataset state not assigned.

Dataset Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric State, and Precipitation at Summit (ICECAPS)   Radiosonde - temperature and humidity profiles Metadata Description: This dataset contains profiles of temperature and humidity observed by Vaisala RS92-K radiosondes that are launched nominally twice daily at Summit, Greenland. These radiosonde profiles do not contain any wind tracking information due to expense. The data are processed by the Vaisala software with the standard "EDT" processing ("wind nominal, PTU nominal" option), and are converted into netCDF format. The ICECAPS field operations at Summit are supported by the National Science Foundation's Arctic Observing Network (AON) Program. Note: In mid-2011, ICECAPS began launching one RS92-K and one RS92-SGP sonde per day. The former does not have wind sounding, but the latter does.

Dataset ARCSS: NSF Arctic System Science   Late Holocene Climatic and Environmental Change Inferred from Arctic Lake Sediments Metadata Authoritative Source: data.eol.ucar.edu Author: Darrell Kaufman Principal Investigator: Darrell Kaufman Gifford H. Miller Mark Abbott Jason Briner Feng Sheng Hu David Porinchu Al Werner Glen MacDonald Michael Retelle Raymond Bradley Bette Otto-Bliesner Konrad Hughen Jonathan Overpeck Originator: Darrell Kaufman Point of Contact: Darrell Kaufman Darrell Kaufman Description: This Dataset consists of data which accompanies fourteen papers in a special issue of the Journal of Paleolimnology. These papers report new records of Holocene climate and environmental change from Arctic lakes, with emphasis on the last 2000 years. The study sites span the high latitudes of North America and extend into northwestern Europe. The studies rely on multiple proxy indicators to reconstruct past climate, including: varve thicknesses, chironomid, diatom, and pollen assemblages, biogenic-silica and organic-matter content, oxygen-isotope ratios in diatoms, and the frequency of lake-ice-rafted aggregates. These proxies primarily document changes in past summer temperatures, the main control on physical and biological processes in lakes at high latitudes. The records will be integrated into a larger network of paleoclimate sites to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of climate change and to compare the paleoclimate inferences with the output of general circulation models. The project of which these data are a part contributes to understanding the Arctic system by placing 20th century climatic change into a longer-term context of inter-decadal climatic variability spanning the last 2000 years.

It tested the hypothesis that stored detritus would buffer carbon limitation during winter when gross primary production (GPP) is minimized, resulting in constant rates of community respiration (CR) year-round due to constant temperatures. It used open-channel methods to measure GPP and CR monthly from March 2007 to August 2009. Mean annual GPP was 458 gC/m2. Such a level is typical for temperate desert-streams but was surprising for an Arctic stream. Annual CR (887 gC/m2) was also remarkable. The high metabolism of this stream is explained by an open canopy, moderate year-round temperatures, stable bed, and high bryophyte biomass (48 gAFDM/m2). Strong seasonal cycles of GPP were mirrored by CR (r=0.65) indicating the possibility of carbon limitation during winter. This result falsified our hypothesis that CR would be relatively stable year-round due to a detritus buffer and constant temperature The data are in tab delimited, and Excel spreadsheet files. Note: these data are in process, with updates possible. Progress: Not Assigned - Dataset state not assigned.

(Jamie) Morison Principal Investigator: Miles McPhee Richard Moritz James H. (Jamie) Morison Michael Steele Dr. Knut Aagaard Andreas Heiberg Originator: James H. (Jamie) Morison Point of Contact: James H. (Jamie) Morison Description: This data set contains North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) Aerial CTD Survey data. It includes conductivity, temperature, depth (CTD), pressure, salinity, potential temperature, and density data, which were collected yearly in the Arctic Ocean as part of the NPEO. Investigators landed a helicopter or skiplane on the arctic sea ice and took measurements using a Seabird SBE-19 SeaCAT with a portable winch. They processed the data using the SEASOFT recipe to minimize salinity spiking and correct for a thermal lag of the conductivity cell. Certain constants were determined by empirical trial, which differed slightly for each year. The NPEO is a year-round, automated scientific observatory, deploying various instruments each April in order to learn how the world's northernmost sea helps regulate global climate. It consists of a set of unmanned scientific platforms that record oceanographic, cryospheric, and atmospheric data throughout the year.

(Jamie) Morison Michael Steele Dr. Knut Aagaard Andreas Heiberg Originator: Takatoshi Takizawa Point of Contact: Takatoshi Takizawa Description: This data set contains drifting buoy measurements taken from the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) Compact Arctic Drifters (J-CADs). The J-CAD buoys drift with the ice pack, collecting navigational, atmospheric, and oceanographic measurements, and transmitting the data via satellite. Since 2000, investigators have been conducting operations of the J-CADs to measure the structure of upper-ocean currents and water properties under the multi-year ice of the Arctic Ocean for a better understanding of the role the Arctic Ocean plays in global climate. This data set contains measurements from J-CAD buoys 1, 3, and 4, from years 2000-2002. For each buoy it takes approximately one year to drift through the Arctic Ocean, pass through Fram Strait into the Greenland Sea, and reach the ice edge, where transmission ceases.

Project Continued Core Atmospheric and Snow Measurements at the Summit, Greenland Environmental Observatory Metadata Principal Investigator: Joseph McConnell Description: This award supports the continuation and expansion of long-term measurements of the Arctic atmosphere, snow, and other Earth system components at the Summit, Greenland, Environmental Observatory (GEOSummit). The original measurement program began in 2003 and contributes to the Arctic Observing Network (AON) and the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH). Year-round measurements at least 10 years in duration are required to observe and quantify the roles of large-scale, multiyear oscillations in oceanic and atmospheric circulation (e.g., Arctic Oscillation) as well as long-term changes in industrial emissions and land use. Long-term, broad-spectrum, and high-time-resolution measurements also are required to determine transport pathways and other linkages between low- and mid-latitude industrial emission sources and Arctic climate. Because transport pathways vary strongly with altitude and Summit is the only high elevation observing site in the Arctic and well separated from local emission sources, it is an essential node in AON. Located at an elevation of 3,100 m on the Greenland ice sheet, GEOSummit is part of an network that includes sites at Barrow, Alaska, Alert, Canada, and Mt. Zeppelin, Svalbard. The Broader Impacts of these observations are numerous and include the potential to transform understanding of the role of natural and anthropogenic aerosols in climate forcing, improve climate models and the prediction of future Arctic environmental change, and enhance the interpretation of ice core records of palaeo-environmental variability. The program also will include education and training, with an emphasis on the participation of under-represented groups, through the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral associate.

Project IPY Back to the Future (BTF): Re-sampling old research sites to assess change in high latitude terrestrial ecosystem structure and function Metadata Principal Investigator: Craig Tweedie Description: Craig Tweedie of the University of Texas at El Paso will determine how key structural and functional characteristics of high latitude terrestrial ecosystems in the Arctic have changed over the past 25 or more years and predict whether such changes are likely to continue. The PI will play a leading role in the international Back to the Future project (IPY project #214). He will establish a focused international Back to the Future coordination and invormation web portal; rescue data and re-establish and re-sample four princicpal ecological study sites including the International Biological Program (IBP) site near Barrow, Alaska, the Research in Arctic Terrestrial Ecosystems (RATE) site near Atqasuk, Alaska, and the PhD dissertation sites of two well known and respected Arctic plant ecologists, Pat Webber (Central Baffin Island) and Terry Callaghan, Disko Island (West Greenland); and coordinate two international Back to the Future synthesis meetings. Date will be archived for open access at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Studenst will assist in re-sampling historical research sites and gain hands-on research experience under the mentorship of Webber and Callaghan as the latter re-sample sites of their own Ph.D. research approximately 40 years after they were established. The project will elucidate decadal scale ecosystem changes in multiple land cover types across the Arctic; validate and improve models of environmental change based on remote sensing; assess the impact of global change on ecosystem structure and function including arctic plant biodiversity; and improve our knowledge feedback mechanisms between land and atmospheric subsystems of the arctic. Undergratuate students, a graduate student, and a postdoctoral fellow will be trained and mentored at a leading minority serving institution. The students will be mentored by pioneering and accomplished Arctic researchers.

Project Monitoring the Thermal State of Permafrost (TSP) in Arctic Alaska using the DOI/GTN-P Deep Borehole Array Metadata Principal Investigator: Gary Clow Description: These data consist of fully processed borehole temperature logs acquired by the U.S. Geological Survey from the 23-element DOI/GTN-P Deep Borehole Array in arctic Alaska beginning in 1973. Processing steps include: application of the appropriate calibration factors, noise removal, and deconvolution of the signal to correct for the thermal memory of the temperature sensor as it was lowered downhole at a constant rate. Pre-1984 logs were acquired at fixed depth intervals using the stop-and-go logging method and hence did not require deconvolution. The logs in this dataset represent the true temperatures in the wellbores and surrounding rocks at the time of the measurements; they have not been corrected for the thermal disturbance caused by circulating fluids and other processes while drilling the wells. The majority of the well sites are located on the arctic coastal plain between the Brooks Range and the Arctic Ocean while the others are in the foothills to the south.

Project North Pole Station: A Distributed Long-Term Observatory Metadata Principal Investigator: James Morison Collaborating Principal Investigator: Miles McPhee Robert Collier CO Principal Investigator: Michael Steele Andreas Heiberg Richard Moritz Knut Aagaard Description: The purpose of the North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) is to help track and understand ongoing changes in the arctic environment, and to increase the availability of long-term environmental data in the Arctic by providing a data and infrastructure resource for other polar science and climate investigations. NPEO was first established in 2000 and includes an automated drifting station of buoys fixed to the sea ice, an ocean mooring, and airborne hydrographic surveys. The North Pole is an excellent location for long-term measurements. Near the flank of the Lomonosov Ridge, it has proven to be a sensitive site for changes in upper ocean frontal structure and changes in the Atlantic water flowing along the ridge. A history of expeditions to the North Pole provides a benchmark of ocean and sea ice observations. The drifting station deployment at the North Pole fills a geographic gap in drifting buoy coverage of the International Arctic Buoy Program s (IABP). Time series observations of ice thickness there provide a unique measure of sea ice in the Transpolar Drift. The airborne hydrographic surveys reach critical areas that are difficult to reach by other means. NPEO observations are necessary to understand the impacts of a changing Arctic environment on ecosystems, indigenous communities and society at large. NPEO enhances the infrastructure for research by providing basic infrastructure and data for research activities in the Arctic.

Project Study of Arctic Ecosystem Changes in the IPY using the International Tundra Experiment Metadata Principal Investigator: Steven Oberbauer Collaborating Principal Investigator: Robert Hollister Julia Klein Jeffrey Welker CO Principal Investigator: Caroline Lewis William Gould Description: This collaborative project is composed of the following: 0632277 (Oberbauer, Florida International University, LEAD), 0632184 (Welker, UAA), 0632144 (Klein, CSU) and 0632263 (Hollister, GVSU) and will use isotopes and remote sensing to measure phenology, community composition, and ecosystem properties in response to background climate changes and to long-term warming treatments in continuation of work begun under the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX). The overarching goals of this project are to use the sampling power of the ITEX Network to quantify changes in phenology, vegetation, and ecosystem properties that have occurred in tundra over the past 10-15 years in response to climate change and experimental warming, and to use the Network as the foundation for monitoring and prediction of future changes. Among the earliest signals of climate warming in the Arctic have been changes in the seasonal timing of life cycle events (phenology). Plants are leafing, flowering, and fruiting earlier than ever recorded. Because phenology and physiology are tightly coupled, ecosystem functions such as primary production, as well as the outcome of competition depend on phenological responses. Species phenological and physiological responses to warming differ, causing changes in community composition, biodiversity, and ecosystem function. However, in contrast to phenology, change in community composition is difficult to detect and ascribe to a particular phenomenon. Changes in phenology and species abundance being reported across the Arctic are consistent with the findings of the long-term experimental warming of the ITEX network, a plot-scale, nondestructive, warming experiment conducted across the tundra biome beginning in 1990. Remote sensing analyses have also detected earlier greening and increased biomass across polar regions, but cannot readily identify the basis for changes in community composition, can only infer function, and can say nothing about community trajectories. Intellectual merit: The ITEX network was specifically designed to study phenology and community composition, and has also been used effectively to study ecosystem processes. The ITEX network is perfectly positioned for an intensive, comprehensive study of decadal-scale changes in phenology, community composition, and ecosystem function in response to background climate change, and has the added value of long-term experimental warming. The baseline data and sampling power of the ITEX network and its experimental approach are unparalleled. We will compare the results of a renewed field campaign of phenology and plant community composition measurements on warmed and control plots during the IPY with our historical data from 10-15 years ago. The investigators will run two workshops to synthesize the long-term phenological and community changes observed across the network. Furthermore, a new suite of minimally invasive measurements will cross compare indices of ecosystem function - including: leaf, litter, and soil nutrients; isotopic composition; and secondary chemistry - in the control and warmed plots across the network. The long-term nature of these experiments and the global coverage of the coordinated network will lead to unique insights regarding the tundra response to past, ongoing, and future climate changes. Broader Impacts: This study will provide research opportunities and training for two young investigators, a postdoctoral fellow, and graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. The investigators will also actively seek participation of underrepresented residents of the community at Barrow, Alaska, and have incorporated public awareness components about the teleconnections between the Arctic and the Earth System in the communities of Anchorage, AK and Miami, FL. The findings of this work will be published as broadly synthetic works of international interest. Because of teleconnections, findings of this circumpolar project will be of general importance to decision makers. Finally, meetings of the ITEX network will provide a learning experience rich in synthetic understanding of topics from a variety of international and cultural viewpoints. Relevance to IPY: This project meets the goals of the IPY program as an international network with a strong research, networking and outreach components studying effects of warming and climate variability on ecosystems in the Arctic. The ITEX network has been specifically endorsed by the IPY Secretariat as project #188 as demonstrating a high level of adherence to IPY themes and goals. A related endorsement of the Circumarctic Terrestrial Biodiversity (CAT-B) initiative, an offshoot of ITEX, is further evidence of the relevance of this program to IPY. The project will also link with other IPY themes including Back to the Future and The Greening of the Arctic.

Title: Barnhart 2010 Glaciomarine Sediment Flux and Transportation Mechanisms, Kronebreen/Kongsvegen, Kongsfjorden, Svalbard Description: Abstract: Arctic tidewater glaciers are likely to respond rapidly to changes in climate, due to a variety of climate forcing mechanisms. This study is designed to assess how these glaciers are now responding to these changes. We collected marine sediment samples near Kronebreen/Kongsvegan, a polythermal subpolar tidewater glacier in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, over the summer melt season of 2009. CTD/OBS and meteorological data were also collected to characterize this dynamic Arctic system. One-to-three-day modern sediment records were collected near the top, the middle, and the bottom of the fjord water column with mooring locations ranging in depth from 20 to 120 m below sea level. Accumulation rates from the bottommost sediment traps of 380, 220, and 160 kg/m2/yr were found at 0.45, 0.75, and 1.00 km, respectively, from the ice-marginal delta on the southern edge of Kronebreen/Kongsvegan. Sedimentation rates appear to decrease logarithmically away from the ice-marginal delta. Couplets of coarse and fine sediment were found in sediment traps from the meltwater sediment plume indicating a diurnal meltwater discharge pattern. The couplets may be due more to solar incidence than to temperature and precipitation. Tidal current velocity may play a role in differentiating coarse and fine particles as they are released from the meltwater sediment plume, but there is not sufficient evidence to test for this fully.

Dataset Chemical Weathering and Organic Carbon Export from Arctic Watersheds, North Slope, Alaska   Chemical weathering and organic carbon geochemistry of six Arctic watersheds, North Slope, Alaska, 2009-2010 Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: Andrew Jacobson Author(s): Douglas, T.A. , A.D. Jacobson, J.W. McClelland, A.J. Barker, M.S. Khosh, and G.O. Lehn Description: This project seeks to identify mineral weathering reactions and hydrologic processes that control how and at what rate the inorganic solute geochemistry of water evolves during transport within Arctic soils and streams and to establish linkages between chemical weathering phenomena and organic carbon export. Water samples were collected from six watersheds near the Arctic Long Term Ecological Research Station on the North Slope of Alaska. All rivers drain continuous permafrost, but three drain tussock tundra-dominated watersheds (Kuparuk, Imnaviat, and Oksrukuyuk) and three drain bare bedrock catchments with minor tundra influences (Atigun, Roche, and Trevor). Water samples were collected from April until October in 2009 and 2010. Water samples were characterized in the field for pH, temperature, conductivity, and alkalinity (Gran titration). In the laboratory, samples were analyzed for concentrations of cations (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Sr, and NH4), anions (Br, Cl, F, NO2, NO3, PO4, and SO4), Si, TDN, DOC, DON, POC, PON, and trace metals (Be, B, Al, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Sr, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, Te, and Ba). River samples were analyzed for O and H isotope ratios (18O/16O and 2H/1H) to identify water sources. Sulfur isotope ratios (34S/32S) of SO4 were measured to track riverine sulfate sources. C and N isotope ratios (13C/12C and 15N/14N) of POC were measured to track sources of organic carbon in streams. Ca and Sr isotope ratios (44Ca/40Ca and 87Sr/86Sr), combined with C isotope ratios (13C/12C) of DIC, were measured to track solute sources from mineral weathering. Two soil cores were collected from Imnaviat watershed. Cores were sectioned into 5cm intervals and were analyzed by XRF (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Ba, Fe, Cu, Zn, Ga, Pb, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, and Tl). Pore waters from each section were collected and analyzed for trace metals by ICP-MS (B, Al, P, Sc, Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Ba, and Tl).

Title: Cobin 2008 Evaluation of Modern Sedimentation Processes in a Proglacial Lake: Linnévatnet, Spitsbergen, Svalbard Description: Abstract: Cores from proglacial lake, Lake Linné, on Svalbard contain varves that hold important information about past climate change. By establishing a relationship between modern sedimentation and measured environmental conditions, we hope to calibrate the late Holocene sediment record found in Lake Linné. Since 2003 sediment trap moorings at five locations in the lake have provided proximal to distal records of overall lake sedimentation. Each mooring also had multiple traps positioned at various water depths, providing insights into the sediment distribution processes in the basin. Trap data show a clear proximal to distal decrease in sediment accumulation and grain size. The data also show an increase in sediment accumulation and grain size as water depth increases. In the most proximal traps, the finest sediment is found at the traps bottom in a very thin layer. It is followed by an abrupt increase in particle size, which grades to the coarsest sediment found in each trap. During May of 2007, prior to the spring melt, sediment traps were deployed, and an automated camera was set-up to take pictures of the inflow into the lake. The spring traps do not record any of the fine sediment found in the bottom of the yearly traps, suggesting that the majority of sediment in the yearlong traps was deposited during/after the spring melt. In addition to the spring traps and camera, snow sensors and meteorological data associate the abrupt increase in particle size with the loss of the snow pack during the spring melt. After the loss of the snowpack, other pulses of coarse sediment are linked to rainfall events in the valley. In contrast, the sediment collected at the top of the traps in July and August, the height of the ablation season, has a finer texture (fine silt and clay). These findings are consistent with data from previous years, suggesting that for systems like Lake Linné, silt laminations are related to high stream discharge events, resulting from the loss of snow pack and large rain events. The annual clay layer thickness is related to the amount of annual glacier ablation, indicating that the thickness of the clay laminations in the lake cores may be the best proxy for reconstructing late Holocene glacier mass balance. The thickness and the texture of the corresponding silt laminations are related to the environmental conditions, sediment that is remobilized in the fluvial system during high discharge events.

RAPID: Impact of Large Scale Greenland Ice Sheet Melting on Glacier Hydrology and Meltwater Geochemistry If you have published a scientific paper using ACADIS data, please consider filling out our ACADIS Publication Survey .

Register  |  Login Home Get Data Search Science Keyword Topics Principal Investigators Projects Geographic Tools Contribute Data Templates & Guides About Contact JavaScript must be enabled. Cookies must be enabled. Dataset RAPID: Impact of Large Scale Greenland Ice Sheet Melting on Glacier Hydrology and Meltwater Geochemistry   RAPID: Impact of Large Scale Greenland Ice Sheet Melting on Glacier Hydrology and Meltwater Geochemistry Metadata Download Data Description: In 2012, multiple lines of evidence suggest a record release of freshwater from the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS), the largest expanse of glacial ice in the Northern Hemisphere and a major source of meltwater and associated material to the surrounding North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Between July 8 and 12, satellite-derived estimates of surface melt increased from 40% to 97% of the ice sheet. This warming received widespread media attention and public interest, yet the scientific community lacks direct observations of meltwater controls on ice sheet movement and meltwater geochemistry for such a large-scale melting event. The overarching goal of this RAPID proposal is to quantify, in short order, the impact of a large-scale melting event on the ice sheet dynamics and meltwater biogeochemistry of a large, land-terminating glacier on the western Greenland margin. RAPID funds will enable the analysis and synthesis of a unique sample set collected during other fieldwork from the Leverett Glacier catchment, a large outlet glacier that discharges through a single proglacial river. Though the focus is on the 2012 episode, the investigators will also analyze samples and GrIS dynamics data from two field seasons (2011- 12), which will aid in interpretation of changes driven by the historic melting event owing to the highly contrasting annual freshwater discharge rates. The investigators will use time-series radiogenic (beryllium-7 and radon-222) and stable isotopes (oxygen and hydrogen), each with unique sources and constant production rates, from the Leverett glacier watershed to differentiate the fractions of meltwater sourced from recent surface snow, glacial ice and delayed flow meltwater. They will also investigate the composition and magnitude of nutrient and metal fluxes released from the subglacial environment and study how these fluxes evolved during July 2012. From 2011-12, parallel ice sheet geophysical data (GPS, satellite imagery) and meltwater biogeochemistry samples (carbon, macro- and micro-nutrients) have been collected by the PI and colleagues from universities in the United Kingdom. The proposed project will fully fund a Ph.D. student, and high school students and undergraduate interns will be recruited to assist with the laboratory aspect of the research. In order to increase the visibility of this project among the general public, the PI and student will co-author an article for the WHOI magazine Oceanus. This publication reaches a wide audience through both print- and web-based editions.

Dataset RAPID: Impact of Large Scale Greenland Ice Sheet Melting on Glacier Hydrology and Meltwater Geochemistry   RAPID: Impact of Large Scale Greenland Ice Sheet Melting on Glacier Hydrology and Meltwater Geochemistry Metadata Description: In 2012, multiple lines of evidence suggest a record release of freshwater from the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS), the largest expanse of glacial ice in the Northern Hemisphere and a major source of meltwater and associated material to the surrounding North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Between July 8 and 12, satellite-derived estimates of surface melt increased from 40% to 97% of the ice sheet. This warming received widespread media attention and public interest, yet the scientific community lacks direct observations of meltwater controls on ice sheet movement and meltwater geochemistry for such a large-scale melting event. The overarching goal of this RAPID proposal is to quantify, in short order, the impact of a large-scale melting event on the ice sheet dynamics and meltwater biogeochemistry of a large, land-terminating glacier on the western Greenland margin. RAPID funds will enable the analysis and synthesis of a unique sample set collected during other fieldwork from the Leverett Glacier catchment, a large outlet glacier that discharges through a single proglacial river. Though the focus is on the 2012 episode, the investigators will also analyze samples and GrIS dynamics data from two field seasons (2011- 12), which will aid in interpretation of changes driven by the historic melting event owing to the highly contrasting annual freshwater discharge rates. The investigators will use time-series radiogenic (beryllium-7 and radon-222) and stable isotopes (oxygen and hydrogen), each with unique sources and constant production rates, from the Leverett glacier watershed to differentiate the fractions of meltwater sourced from recent surface snow, glacial ice and delayed flow meltwater. They will also investigate the composition and magnitude of nutrient and metal fluxes released from the subglacial environment and study how these fluxes evolved during July 2012. From 2011-12, parallel ice sheet geophysical data (GPS, satellite imagery) and meltwater biogeochemistry samples (carbon, macro- and micro-nutrients) have been collected by the PI and colleagues from universities in the United Kingdom. The proposed project will fully fund a Ph.D. student, and high school students and undergraduate interns will be recruited to assist with the laboratory aspect of the research. In order to increase the visibility of this project among the general public, the PI and student will co-author an article for the WHOI magazine Oceanus. This publication reaches a wide audience through both print- and web-based editions. Finally, the Ph.D. student will continue to report on the results of this study via an Expedition Blog called "Following the Ice" on Scientific American (http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/expeditions/tag/following-the-ice/).

Dataset Collaborative Research: Greenland Meltwater Geomicrobiology   Diversity and potential sources of microbiota associated with snow on western portions of the Greenland Ice Sheet Metadata Download Data Description: Snow overlays the majority of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). However, there is very little information available on the microbiological assemblages that are associated with this vast and climate-sensitive landscape. In this study, the structure and diversity of snow microbial assemblages from two regions of the western GrIS ice margin were investigated through the sequencing of small subunit ribosomal RNA genes. The origins of the microbiota were investigated by examining correlations to molecular data obtained from marine, soil, freshwater and atmospheric environments and geochemical analytes measured in the snow. Snow was found to contain a diverse assemblage of bacteria (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria) and eukarya (Alveolata, Fungi, Stramenopiles and Chloroplastida). Phylotypes related to archaeal Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota phyla were also identified. The snow microbial assemblages were more similar to communities characterized in soil than to those documented in marine ecosystems. Despite this, the chemical composition of snow samples was consistent with a marine contribution, and strong correlations existed between bacterial beta diversity and the concentration of Na+ and Cl−. These results suggest that surface snow from western regions of Greenland contains exogenous microbiota that were likely aerosolized from more distant soil sources, transported in the atmosphere and co-precipitated with the snow.

Dataset Spatial and Temporal Influences of Thermokarst Failures on Surface Processes in Arctic Landscapes   Multiple Element Limitation Thermal Erosion Features Metadata Description: We calibrated the Multiple Element Limitation (MEL IVarc, Rastetter et al., 2013 and Pearce et al., in press) model to Alaskan arctic tundra to simulate recovery of thermal erosion features (TEFs) caused by permafrost thaw and mass wasting. The MEL model was calibrated to match annual C, N, P and water fluxes of tussock tundra on the North Slope of Alaska near Toolik Lake, AK (68° 38'N, 149° 43'W) (see Pearce, in press for details). The calibrated simulates acidic tussock tundra under 2000 climatic conditions, warming, warming and fertilization, fertilization, and decreased solar radiation reasonably well. In all TEF simulations we assumed that the slope failure caused by the disturbance had stabilized prior to the start of the simulation and that there was no ongoing downslope mass transfer. We cut initial biomass by 90% to reflect the loss of the majority of the standing biomass after a thermal erosion disturbance. We than ran several simulations with varying Phase I and Phase II SOM to reflect a range of possible post-disturbance conditions among and within TEFs. We also simulated conditions that result in a higher availability of nutrients than in the undisturbed tundra used for our calibration. Progress: Completed - Dataset fully collected/analyzed.

Title: Magnabosco 2011 A Characterization of the Biology and Nutrient Cycling of Two Glacial Lakes in Isfjord Radio, Svalbard Description: Abstract: Due to the fact that lakes in the high arctic are only exposed for two to three months out of the year, very little is known about the microbiology and nutrient cycling that occur in this region. Of greatest interest in these high arctic regions are the primary producers that control the majority of the biogeochemical cycling and carbon dioxide sequestration of the region. Therefore, it is important to understand how industrialization of the 20th and 21st centuries is affecting these delicate and vital ecosystems. This study explores two glacial lakes in the high arctic regionof Svalbard. In order to gain insight on the nitrate and phosphate supply ratios driving primary production in the region, a series of nutrient enrichment experiments (mesocosms) on eleven locations throughout Isfjord Radio, Svalbard were performed. Theresults of these experiments reveal that the primary producers of this region are highly responsive to the increased nitrogen deposition from the burning of fossil fuels in North America and Europe. In particular, this study shows that, the past decade alone, diatom diversity within these two lakes has significantly decreased in response to the increased nitrogen loading of these freshwater systems.

This data set includes diverse measurements of seawater chemistry along with supporting conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) data from the Arctic Ocean near the North Pole. Measurements were taken from sea ice platforms each April or May from 2000-2008. Investigators used a CTD-O2 system to measure seawater conductivity, temperature, depth, and dissolved oxygen content, and collected Niskin bottle samples for measurements of salinity, oxygen isotopes composition, total alkalinity, and concentrations of phosphate, silicic acid, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and barium. The available in-situ dissolved oxygen measurements were collected beginning in 2002. Beginning with the 2007 deployment, an in-situ ultraviolet spectrophotometer (ISUS) was used to measure nitrate concentrations in the water column. The North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) is a year-round, scientific observatory, deploying various instruments each April in order to learn how the world's northernmost sea helps regulate global climate. Supported by repeat hydrographic profiles, it includes a set of unmanned scientific platforms that record oceanographic, cryospheric, and atmospheric data throughout the year.

Small Canadian Arctic River Flows 2014 If you have published a scientific paper using ACADIS data, please consider filling out our ACADIS Publication Survey .

Dataset Collaborative Research: Assessing the Impact of Small, Canadian Arctic River Flows (SCARFs) to the Freshwater Budget of the Canadian Archipelago             Small Canadian Arctic River Flows   Small Canadian Arctic River Flows 2014 Metadata Description: The contribution of small Canadian Arctic rivers to the total freshwater flux through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) is unknown and remains a significant gap in the growing data set addressing the freshwater budget of the Arctic and subarctic oceans. Limited geochemical data have been collected from the CAA, Nares Strait, and Baffin Bay, and the existing data sets are too sparse to differentiate among the various freshwater sources thought to contribute to the total freshwater pool (i.e., Pacific water, sea-ice meltwater, and meteoric water derived from the Mackenzie River, Eurasian rivers, and local runoff). New programs have begun to collect requisite geochemical data in Davis Strait and other regions. However, interpretation of these measurements may be biased by typical endmember assignments associated with Eurasian and North American river runoff. Characterizing the geochemical signature of local freshwater inputs is essential for distinguishing these contributions from those of Arctic Ocean origin, but virtually no studies have sampled small Arctic rivers discharging into the CAA. Available data collected from Baffin Bay and Hudson Strait suggest local rivers do not resemble the Mackenzie and Yukon Rivers typically assumed to represent North American runoff. While the annual discharge of any given river is relatively small, the combined discharge of all rivers is sufficient to support nearshore, narrow boundary currents, which provide an important, but often neglected, transport mechanism. Thus, local contributions of freshwater may impact the total volume flux and geochemistry of the Canadian Arctic throughflow that has historically been attributed entirely to export from the Arctic Ocean. The project consists of a three-year study to characterize the total alkalinity, barium, DOC, major ion and isotope (δ18O, 87Sr/86Sr) geochemistry of remote CAA rivers and estuaries with the ultimate aim of resolving the contribution of local freshwater inputs to CAA boundary currents. River sampling will occur during different flow regimes, but emphasize the spring freshet, the time of year when terrestrial runoff from local CAA rivers maximally impacts coastal waters. Estuarine sampling will include both horizontal and vertical profiles. The study focuses on eight rivers: the Coppermine, Ellice, Back, Hayes, Kuujuua, Thomsen, Cunningham, and Clyde Rivers. During summer field seasons of 2014-2016, four researchers are transported to each site via Twin Otter aircraft. Field operations begin at Kugluktuk (Coppermine River) in early July 2014 (river sampling only) and in early August of 2015 and 2016 (river and estuary sampling). Researchers spend 3-5 days at each site. The team utilizes airports located at Kugluktuk, Clyde River, and Ulukhaktok. More remote sites near the Thomsen, Ellice, Cunningham, and Back Rivers are accessed via equipping the Twin Otter with tundra tires. River water samples are collected by wading into the river and using an extendable pole to collect bulk (1L) samples from the central current. Bulk samples are then immediately filtered using a peristaltic pump and small subsamples are collected. Weekly samples are also collected by local workers in the more populated regions surrounding the Coppermine and Clyde Rivers to gain insight into the changes in river chemistry over the course of the spring and summer flow periods. Samples are collected from estuaries adjoining the river mouths from small, inflatable boats and a peristaltic pump equipped with multiple lengths of C-FLEX tubing.

Title: Field surveys - Light transparency and water temperature profiles, August 2013 (CALON) Description: Data include raw downwelling irradiance against depth, attenuation coefficients (Kd), and 1% and 10% attenuation depths in meters for 305 nm, 320 nm, and 380 nm ultraviolet light as well as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 400-700 nm). BIC units for UV irradiance are in mW cm-2 nm-1, which can be converted to the SI unit mW m-2 by multiplying BIC values by 10. BIC units for PAR irradiance are mmol m-2 sec-1. The attenuation coefficients are calculated using the following relationship: Kd = ln(Io/Iz) / Z where Io and Iz represent the light intensities at an upper and lower depth separated by a depth of Z meters. The 1% and 10% attenuation depths are calculated based upon the Kd value for each wavelength. Note that if the water is highly transparent the calculated 1% and 10% depths can exceed the depth of the lake. Temperature readings for each depth are also made during each profile. The top of the thermocline is estimated as the point where the water temperature drops at least 1 degree Celsius in 1 m.

Title: Wei 2011 Analysis of Varved Sediment and Weather Relationships in Lake Linné, Svalbard Description: Abstract: The debate involving climate change has become increasingly important in the recent decade. Arctic environments are important locations for study as they are particularly sensitive to climate variations. Proglacial lake sediments, particularly varves, such as those found at Lake Linné, on the island of Spitsbergen, Svalbard, demonstrate this sensitivity as they are driven by glacial ablation. The correlation of cores from different locations in Lake Linné has served to address inconsistencies in the varve record across the lake. The relationship between measured varve thickness and weather parameters is based on meteorological records for the past century, and demonstrates the responsiveness of varves to changes in climate and weather. The strongest relationships between varves and weather were between positive degree estimates and varve thicknesses. Proximal locations showed the strongest values (r-squared = 0.331), while summer thickness measurements at an intermediate deep basin site correlated best with the past two decades (r-squared = 0.45). The measuring and counting of varves allowed the construction of a chronology that then serves as a climate proxy for Svalbard for the past century. The varve analysis from this study reveals the complexity of the sedimentation in Lake Linné, and it attempts to define the other likely factors that contribute to varve deposition. Overall, the assembled climate relationships reveal varves which can be linked to changes in weather and climate patterns, and a response of the Lake Linné proglacial system in the last two decades to climate change.

Title: Zamora 2010 Using Sediment Geochemistry, Particle Size Distribution and Remote Sensing to Study Provenance in the Kronebreen/Kongsvegen Glaciers, West Spitsbergen, Svalbard Description: Abstract: Sediment provenance at the Kronerbreen/Kongsvegen glaciers in Spitsbergen can be used to understand the effects that climate change can have on the sedimentation in fjords, and streams at northern latitudes. These sediments are directly related to glacial processes and reflect the conditions under which they formed. Such conditions are sensitive to global climate change, which is amplified in northern latitudes, creating a unique environment for climate change research. Quantitative provenance studies have never been carried out in the Kongsfjorden before, and can provide data for a better understanding of glacial processes and dynamics, and changes in erosional conditions. Particularly, sedimentation rates and sediment grain size distribution can help unravel the glacial history of the area. This study will focus on analyzing the grain size distribution of the material being deposited by the mentioned glaciers and finding the source rock of these sediments. Fine sediment was transported by streams and upflows identified in the field, and fed by the glaciers melting ice. On the other hand, coarser material ranging from cobble to boulder size was deposited by ice, moraines, and alluvial processes. Sediment and rock samples were collected during the months of July and August 2009, along the terminus of the glacier, and in the surrounding areas, respectively. Grain size analysis was performed on the samples using a Malvern Mastersizer with the resulting in different groups showing a change in particle size and sorting depending on the location along the glacier. This analysis is important as mineral composition and transportation is influenced by grain size. Electron microprobe studies were carried out on sediment grains to obtain a rough compositional profile of the sediments, and a first-order mineralogical make-up. The microprobe results provided us with information about composition of some of the minerals present, based on the content of Fe, Ca, K and Al derived from the erosion of the local lithologies. Chemical composition can distinguish sediments derived from different sources, and may ultimately be compared with representative rock samples taken from the moraines. Due to the limited accessibility to some areas, many geological units in the Kongsfjorden area have not been mapped or studied, limiting the possible comparisons with contributing material to the fjord’s seafloor. Remote sensing techniques were used to map lithologies in previously unmapped regions using ENVI®, and ASTER satellite imagery. A GER 3700 radiospectrometer was used to collect spectral properties of the rock samples. These properties were compared to the outcrops in the satellite imagery giving us an idea of the bedrock composition of the area. The results of our research can be compared with future studies in order to obtain information, regarding responses in the glacier dynamics and processes, related to climate change.

Dataset A Prototype Network for Measuring Arctic Winter Precipitation and Snow Cover (SnowNet 1 and 2)             Time Series Data (SnowNet)                         Barrow_timeseries   Barrow_timeseries_eSWE_Sensor Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: Matthew Sturm Description: Barrow site time series data from the eSWE Sensor. The electronic snow-water equivalent (SWE) sensor a modular sensor that consists of nine 3-ft x 3-ft aluminum panels. All panels are identically constructed. The modularity allows SWE to be measured in the center of the sensor surrounded by inert panels that buffer any sensor stress concentrations that may arise at the edge of the sensor. Construction of the sensor is also simplified since all panels are identical, only the use of a load cell or dummy spacer are used to support the aluminum plate.Three load cells are currently installed on the SWE sensor. Two load cells are placed under the center panel and the third is under the middle outer panel. The load cell type is a hermetically sealed load cell calibrated in compression. The model HSW-2K is manufactured by Transducer Techniques. Progress: Not Assigned - Dataset state not assigned.

Cloud occurrence fraction determines the first order impact of clouds on the climate system. This collection of data sets documents cloud occurrence and, to the degree possible, cloud vertical distribution at multiple locations across the Arctic. Observations are based on the available surface-based, remote-sensor measurements. From this perspective, the definition used here for cloud presence is based on the ability for remote-sensors to detect hydrometeors in the atmosphere.

Project Core Atmospheric Measurements at Summit, Greenland Environmental Observatory Metadata Principal Investigator: Roger Bales Description: This project involves long-term core measurements of the Arctic atmosphere, snow and other Earth system components at the Summit Greenland Environmental Observatory (GEOSummit). GEOSummit was the site of the GISP2 ice core, completed in 1993, and has been a site of atmospheric, snow and other geophysical measurements ever since. It is currently the only high-altitude site for atmospheric and related measurements in the Arctic. As global atmospheric temperatures rise, the Arctic environment is expected to undergo more rapid change in response to human influences than are other parts of the Earth system, in part due to feedbacks related to decreasing snowcover and sea-ice extent. Observed changes in Arctic temperature, atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric circulation are expected to have potentially broad but uncertain effects on Arctic systems. A number of processes that could amplify atmospheric change need consistent measurements and systematic study. For example, recent evidence indicates that important atmospheric chemical constituents undergo temperature-dependent exchange with ice/snow, and that some species are photochemically transformed and/or produced within the sunlit surface snowpack. Because changes in Arctic atmospheric circulation are cyclic over 4-5 year or longer times, long-duration measurements are needed to understand circulation and to place observed changes in a long-term perspective.

Title: CTD Data 2010 Description: This data set contains the raw .hex files and the .cnv from conductivity temperature depth (CTD) casts conducted near Barrow, AK from August 21 - September 8, 2010. Details of the latitude, longitude, date, and time are listed in the event log that is archived at this site. Date, time, position, bottom depth, and project sample line also are listed in each file. Each CTD file is named sequentially; corresponding station numbers are listed in the event log. No CTD data were recorded at stations 45 and 46 because of battery failure so CTD files 45 and 46 are missing from the sequence. Data were collected from the research vessel R/V Annika Marie using a SeaBird (SBE) 19+ CTD sensor equipped with a Wetlabs WetStar WS3S fluorometer and Biospherical Instrument Inc. Model QSP2300 PAR/irradiance sensor sensor. No post-processing of the data was done. Fluorescence is reported as mg/m3 chlorophyll a, with conversion from volts according to factory calibrations. These values were ground-truthed to extracted chlorophyll from samples collected using Niskin bottles. The reported chlorophyll a values in the CTD files need to be corrected according to the equation: Y=0.1334X +0.1437 Where X is the value from the WetLabs Fluorometer and Y is the corrected value in mg/m3. The files have been zipped into two files for ease. The .con file used by SeaSoft also is included and is zipped into each of the files.

Title: Imnaviat Creek Alaska - Fen Station IC 1523 Consolidated Dataset Description: The Ridge and the Fen sites at Imnaviat creek are identical and support identical sensor suites. The heart of each system is an open-path eddy covariance system that measures the fluxes of carbon dioxide, water vapour and energy. In addition to this, each system measures standard meteorological and subsurface variables such as wind speed, air temperature and soil energy fluxes. The majority of these sensors were supplied by Campbell Scientific, Inc. The CSAT3 and the LI7500 form the core of the eddy covariance (EC) system and are used to measure high frequency fluctuations of the concentration of CO2, H2O and vertical wind speed in order to determine FCO2, Qe and Qh. Additionally, wind direction is determined by using the two horizontal measurements of wind speed from the CSAT3. The EC systems are positioned at heights of 3.18m and 2.20m at the Ridge and Fen sites respectively. The LI7500s are positioned 150 degrees behind each CSAT3 at a distance of 15cm and are oriented 30 degrees from vertical to reduce snow/ice/rain accumulation on the lenses. This results in an estimated measurement rejection angle of 30 degrees directly behind each EC system. At each station, the EC systems are oriented 150 degrees from true north into the dominant yearly wind direction in order to maximize the probability that measurements will be taken outside of the instrument rejection angle. Accordingly, the Renewable Energy Plants are located 30m away and in the centre of the measurement rejection zone. The other basic meteorological instruments such as the albedometer, the net radiometer, the PAR sensor, the Sonic Ranger, the tipping bucket rain gauge and the soil heat flux instruments are necessary to complete our measurements of the components of the energy balance in order to evaluate the performance of the EC system with an energy balance closure calculation and assist us with the quality control of the resultant dataset. Additionally, they assist in the evaluation of the impact of fundamental forcing factors on the observed mass and energy fluxes. Massman, W.J.

The Flattery analysis method was used through 1978Sep21. It forced a relationship between heights and winds which causes the zonal mean meridional wind at every level to be zero. This also caused other problems with winds in equatorial areas. The optimal analysis (OI) method (12 layer) started 1978Sep22. In 1985Apr the Medium Range Forecast (MRF) model started, with 18 layers. Analyses include geopotential height, temperature, wind (u- and v-components) and potential temperature. In more recent years the temperature analyses are derived from thickness temperatures. The National Center for Atmospheric Research's (NCAR) Data Services Section (DSS) maintains this dataset.

Dataset North Pole Station: A Distributed Long-Term Observatory   North Pole Environmental Observatory NPEO Aerial CTD Survey Metadata Download Data Description: This data set includes conductivity, temperature, depth (CTD), pressure, salinity, potential, temperature, and density data, which were collected yearly, 2000 to 2008, in the Arctic Ocean as part of the North Pole Environmental Observatory. Investigators landed a helicopter or skiplane on the arctic sea ice and took measurements using a Seabird SBE-19 Seacat with a portable winch. They processed the data using the Seasoft recipe to minimize salinity spiking and correct for a thermal lag of the conductivity cell. Certain constants were determined by empirical trial, which differed slightly for each year. The North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) is a year-round, automated scientific observatory, deploying various instruments each April in order to learn how the world s northernmost sea helps regulate global climate. It consists of a set of unmanned scientific platforms that record oceanographic, cryospheric, and atmospheric data throughout the year. More information about the project is available at the project Web site, North Pole Environmental Observatory. Data are in tab-delimited ASCII text format.

Dataset North Pole Station: A Distributed Long-Term Observatory   North Pole Environmental Observatory NPEO Oceanographic Mooring Data Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: Roger Andersen Description: This data set, acquired with an oceanographic bottom-anchored mooring, includes sea-ice draft and depth data, conductivity, temperature, pressure, salinity, and ocean current measurements such as speed and direction. Each mooring contains vertically distributed instruments, which measure ocean properties at fixed depths and record data internally. These data are retrieved annually when the mooring is recovered. Located on the Pole Abyssal Plain about 50 kilometers from the North Pole, the original 2001 mooring was chosen because it provided a suitable landing site for the supporting aircraft. Ocean depth was approximately 4300 m. Data were recorded half-hourly to hourly.

Dataset North Pole Station: A Distributed Long-Term Observatory             North Pole Environmental Observatory CTD-O2 Data   North Pole Environmental Observatory CTD-O2 Data: 2003 Metadata Download Data Description: This data set contains CTD-02 data for 2003. This data set includes diverse measurements of seawater chemistry along with supporting conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) data from the Arctic Ocean near the North Pole. Measurements were taken from sea ice platforms each April or May from 2000-2008. Investigators used a CTD-O2 system to measure seawater conductivity, temperature, depth, and dissolved oxygen content, and collected Niskin bottle samples for measurements of salinity, oxygen isotopes composition, total alkalinity, and concentrations of phosphate, silicic acid, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and barium. The available in-situ dissolved oxygen measurements were collected beginning in 2002. Beginning with the 2007 deployment, an in-situ ultraviolet spectrophotometer (ISUS) was used to measure nitrate concentrations in the water column. The North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) is a year-round, scientific observatory, deploying various instruments each April in order to learn how the world's northernmost sea helps regulate global climate. Supported by repeat hydrographic profiles, it includes a set of unmanned scientific platforms that record oceanographic, cryospheric, and atmospheric data throughout the year.

Beginning with the 2007 deployment, an in-situ ultraviolet spectrophotometer (ISUS) was used to measure nitrate concentrations in the water column. The North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) is a year-round, scientific observatory, deploying various instruments each April in order to learn how the world's northernmost sea helps regulate global climate. Supported by repeat hydrographic profiles, it includes a set of unmanned scientific platforms that record oceanographic, cryospheric, and atmospheric data throughout the year.

Dataset Is the Arctic Human Environment Moving to a New State?   Pan-Arctic Political Mask Metadata Point of Contact: NCAR/EOL NCAR/EOL Description: The Pan-Arctic Political Mask, is a raster based dataset of administrative areas and political boundaries in the NSIDC Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) with pixel size of 25.067525 meters. This dataset was produced by combining and rasterizing several vector based political datasets. Among these are the Rusray dataset created by Alexander Perepechko and Dmitry Sharkov for Russia, the Standard Geographical Classification (SGC) 2001 for Canada, the Census 2000 County and County Equivalent Areas dataset for the United States and the GADM database of Global Administrative Areas for Europe. The administrative units for Greenland were taken from the Wikipedia article 'Administrative divisions of Greenland' (accessed 6/23/2010). The Dataset consists of 7 variables. A unique key used for identification (PLACECODE2) and three pairs of Name/Code variables corresponding to the three administrative levels Nation, SubNation and Admin.

Dataset Arctic Great Rivers Observatory   PARTNERS Project Arctic River Biogeochemical Data Metadata Download Data Description: As the precursor to the Arctic Great Rivers Observatory project (Arctic-GRO), the PARTNERS project (NSF-OPP-0229302) was one of 18 proposals funded in 2002 in response to the National Science Foundation - Arctic System Science (NSF-ARCSS) Arctic Freshwater Cycle: Land/Upper-Ocean Linkages solicitation, and is part of a broader set of projects collectively referred to as the Freshwater Integration (FWI) study. We focused on the export and fate of water and water-borne constituents from the pan- arctic watershed. Major field sampling programs were established at downstream stations on the six largest rivers within the pan-arctic watershed; the Yenisey, Ob, Lena, and Kolyma Rivers in Siberia and the Yukon and Mackenzie Rivers in North America. While a variety of previous studies have focused on the chemistry of large arctic rivers, differences in sample collection methods, analytical methods, and the constituents being measured have hampered river inter-comparisons and understanding at the pan-arctic scale. Furthermore, the majority of previous studies were conducted only during summer months. Thus, establishment and implementation of standard protocols (including seasonally representative sampling) for use at all of the rivers was a major advance. International collaborations have been the key to the success of the project. In this collaborative spirit, the project was named PARTNERS (Pan-Arctic River Transport of Nutrients, Organic Matter and Suspended Sediments) although many more constituents and isotopes are collected than the name implies. Biogeochemical data generated during the PARTNERS project are presented here. Most of these measurements will continue beginning in spring 2009 as part of the Arctic-GRO project.

Title: Radar monitoring data collected at two locations in June, 2009, Breidamerkurjokull Description: 5-MHz ground-based radar system was located on two places on Breidamerkurjokull for several days to measure temporal changes of englacial and subglacial properties. The data file includes two structures: Site A and Site B. Each structure includes two radar waveforms (ch0 for a wider amplitude range and ch1 for a narrower amplitude range), corresponding two-way travel time, and time when each radar data was collected (julian day, hour, minute, second, and timestamp = jday + (hour + minute./60 + second./3600)./24). We replaced the batteries of the radar system every day, which is not frequent enough to collect the data continuously. The users of this dataset should pay attention to temporal changes of the radar-transmitting power. Amplitudes of the direct wave can be used to measure this feature caused by decreased voltage of the power supply. Coordinates of two monitoring sites are: Site A: 64.0961N, 16.3441W (WGS84 decimal degrees) Site B: 64.0891N, 16.3357W (WGS84 decimal degrees) Metadata URL: https://www.aoncadis.org/dataset/id/93adf3e8-7d07-11e2-b388-00c0f03d5b7c.html

Dataset Collaborative Research: Controls on the motion of soft-bedded glaciers from hourly to seasonal observations of force budget and basal conditions at Breidamerkurjokull, Iceland   Radar profiling data collected on Breidamerkurjokull in 2009 Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: ACADIS Community Support Author(s): Kenichi Matsuoka, Jessica Lundin, Howard Conway Description: 5-MHz ground-based radar data were collected along three transects roughly follow the ice-flow direction. These three profiles are located each in slow (150-200 m/a, transect a), intermediate (150-250 m/a, transect b), and fast (300-400 m/a, transect c) -flowing regimes of the glacier. Two profiles (a1 and a2) were made for the slow-flow transect for the redundancy purpose. The data are provided in Matlab format. Each profile (a1, a2, b1, c1) has structure including: horizontal positions x and y in the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate (meters), vertical position z above the WGS84 ellipsoid (meters), radar waveform (1024 samples per trace), corresponding two-way travel time (seconds), sampling rate of the radar waveform in nanosecond (10 nsec for this dataset), and days of the year of 2007 and seconds of the day when each radar trace is recorded. No processing is applied to the radar waveforms. However, the echo from the basal interface of the glacier and echoes from within the glacier are clearly recorded.

Title: RAPID: Impact of Large Scale Greenland Ice Sheet Melting on Glacier Hydrology and Meltwater Geochemistry Description: In 2012, multiple lines of evidence suggest a record release of freshwater from the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS), the largest expanse of glacial ice in the Northern Hemisphere and a major source of meltwater and associated material to the surrounding North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Between July 8 and 12, satellite-derived estimates of surface melt increased from 40% to 97% of the ice sheet. This warming received widespread media attention and public interest, yet the scientific community lacks direct observations of meltwater controls on ice sheet movement and meltwater geochemistry for such a large-scale melting event. The overarching goal of this RAPID proposal is to quantify, in short order, the impact of a large-scale melting event on the ice sheet dynamics and meltwater biogeochemistry of a large, land-terminating glacier on the western Greenland margin. RAPID funds will enable the analysis and synthesis of a unique sample set collected during other fieldwork from the Leverett Glacier catchment, a large outlet glacier that discharges through a single proglacial river. Though the focus is on the 2012 episode, the investigators will also analyze samples and GrIS dynamics data from two field seasons (2011- 12), which will aid in interpretation of changes driven by the historic melting event owing to the highly contrasting annual freshwater discharge rates. The investigators will use time-series radiogenic (beryllium-7 and radon-222) and stable isotopes (oxygen and hydrogen), each with unique sources and constant production rates, from the Leverett glacier watershed to differentiate the fractions of meltwater sourced from recent surface snow, glacial ice and delayed flow meltwater. They will also investigate the composition and magnitude of nutrient and metal fluxes released from the subglacial environment and study how these fluxes evolved during July 2012. From 2011-12, parallel ice sheet geophysical data (GPS, satellite imagery) and meltwater biogeochemistry samples (carbon, macro- and micro-nutrients) have been collected by the PI and colleagues from universities in the United Kingdom. The proposed project will fully fund a Ph.D. student, and high school students and undergraduate interns will be recruited to assist with the laboratory aspect of the research. In order to increase the visibility of this project among the general public, the PI and student will co-author an article for the WHOI magazine Oceanus. This publication reaches a wide audience through both print- and web-based editions. Finally, the Ph.D. student will continue to report on the results of this study via an Expedition Blog called &quot;Following the Ice&quot; on Scientific American (http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/expeditions/tag/following-the-ice/). The radon dataset is complete and available for download immediately. The beryllium-7 and water isotope data will be uploaded by August 2015.

Dataset A Modular Approach to Building an Arctic Observing System for the IPY and Beyond in the Switchyard Region of the Arctic Ocean   Sea Ice Motion in the Arctic Ocean Switchyard Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: Ronald Kwok Description: This dataset provides sea ice motion vectors in the Switchyard region of the Arctic Ocean, utilizing measurements from the 89V channel of the AMSR-E instrument on the Aqua platform. The daily fields cover the period of October 1, 2002 through December 31, 2008. They are on a 100km resolution grid in Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI) x/y coordinates, from the North Pole down to the Canadian Archipelago and Greenland coasts, between 0 degrees longitude and 120 degrees west longitude. These ice motion vectors provide measurements of ice circulation and flux in the switchyard region, showing the balance of the sea ice flow going into the Fram Strait and exiting the Arctic Ocean and that flowing toward the Beaufort Sea and remaining within the Arctic system.

Dataset Collaborative research: Glacier seismicity and its relationship to basal movement   Data from subglacial instrumentation at Engabreen 2010-2011 Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: Peter Moore Author(s): Peter L. Moore, Neal R. Iverson, Denis Cohen Description: This data comes from subglacial instrumentation installed in the tunnels beneath Engabreen, Norway. Additional (overlapping in time) datasets from a partner group of seismic and GPS instrumentation is available in a separate archive. For additional information, please see the related publication: Moore, P.L., et al., 2013, Glacier slip and seismicity induced by surface melt, Geology, 10.1130/G34760.1 Data are provided as raw (uncalibrated) output files, along with matlab scripts containing calibration information. The 2010 datasets extend from March 18, 2010 until June 11, 2010; 2011 datasets extend from May 6-24. In the first two weeks of each dataset, pump tests were conducted to investigate the response of the glacier to local water pressure perturbations. In 2010, data come from two different dataloggers, a Campbell CR10X and a Campbell CR1000. In 2011, datasets come from each of these two loggers as well as an Acoustic Emissions system. The included matlab scripts contain commands to load and parse data from the data files and to apply calibrations. The CR10X files output readings from the friction panel, described in the paper referenced above (and its associated online supplementary material). The panel measurements consist of two normal load cells, two shear load cells and two water-pressure transducers installed flush with the bed of the glacier. When calibrations from the matlab scripts are applied, the output yields kilopascals (kPa). NS1, NS2 = normal stress SS1, SS2 = shear stress WP1, WP2 = water pressure CR1000 files contain data from extensometers whose wires were fed through boreholes from he subglacial tunnel to the bed of the glacier, where anchors were embedded in basal ice or left on the glacier bed. Sampling interval in 2010 was 10 Hz, yielding very large files. The May 2010 data segment records some motion, but two extensometers had failed to work by this time. Output is in mm displacement. pot1, pot2, pot3: displacements in mm hammer: a boolean data string indicating whether a hammer-switch circuit was completed -- used to synchronize clocks with subglacial seismometers. The 2011 dataset includes a large number of files like enga066.dat and PRERUN066.txt. These are raw acoustic emissions files from a system also described in the paper referenced above. The system only recorded basic metrics from each AE hit that exceeded a nominal threshold, so there are no waveforms available. Each engaXXX.dat file contains a listing of these metrics from each hit, but contains only a timestamp that resets each time the system started a new file. Thus, the PRERUNXXX.txt file associated with each dat file contains the real time-string, from which timestamps are generated in the matlab script. Output from the script are two vectors: jtimeAE: a list of timestamps corresponding to times when an AE hit exceeded the threshold (40 dB) Amp: hit amplitude, in dB > 40.

Dataset A Modular Approach to Building an Arctic Observing System for the IPY and Beyond in the Switchyard Region of the Arctic Ocean   SwitchYard Bottle Data Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: Hoyle Lee Description: The focus of this project is on the variability of circulation, water mass properties and freshwater distribution in a region that lies north of the Canadian Archipelago and Greenland, extending from the continental shelf into the central Arctic Ocean. This region is just upstream of the freshwater exit points to the North Atlantic Ocean in Nares Strait and Fram Strait. There is evidence that circulation in this region is highly variable on interannual time scales, which may be tied to large-scale climate signals such as the Arctic Oscillation, and results in variability in the export of fresh water to the North Atlantic. This region is covered by thick ice and is difficult to reach by icebreaker, so aircraft operated out of the Canadian military base at Alert are used to perform an annual hydrographic survey for temperature, salinity and chemical properties in this region of the Arctic Ocean. The backbone of the survey is a line of conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD)/rosette stations extending from the continental shelf to the North Pole taken from Twin Otter aircraft using a modular CTD/rosette system that is lowered through a 12" diameter hole drilled in the sea ice. This system is also used to take a few stations east and west of the line, time permitting. Up to 12 water samples are collected at each station between the surface and about 700 m depth. CTD only stations are taken by helicopter and Twin Otter aircraft to provide broader spatial coverage of the region and finer spatial resolution at the continental slope. A single water sample at 1-2 m depth is taken at each of these stations. The continental shelf to North Pole section is carried out by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the broader scale survey by the University of Washington. This survey is closely coordinated with the Twin Otter survey carried out by the North Pole Environmental Observatory program each year. Progress: Completed - Dataset fully collected/analyzed.

Dataset A Modular Approach to Building an Arctic Observing System for the IPY and Beyond in the Switchyard Region of the Arctic Ocean   Switchyard UW CTD data Metadata Download Data Point of Contact: Michael Steele Description: The Switchyard project is a program to study circulation (sea ice and upper ocean) in the region between Alert (Ellesmere Island) and the North Pole, through a series of annual springtime hydrographic surveys, moorings, and sea ice analyses. These University of Washington (UW) Conductivity Temperature Depth (CTD) data were collected using a combination of helicopters and Twin Otter aircraft. In 2003-2006, data were collected by helicopter landing on the sea ice near a lead, where a small winch was used to lower a Seabird (SBE) 19 plus CTD (with dissolved oxygen sensor) down to 500m. Data were collected on a Soutwest-Nnortheast section across the continental slope centered at about 65W, 84N, and also at other locations in the Lincoln Sea as the opportunity presented itself. In 2007, poor weather conditions precluded safe helicopter operations and no UW CTD data were collected. Beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2012, a Twin Otter was used by the UW team to collect CTD profiles as deep as 1000m within a 500 km radius of Alert. In 2010 and 2011, Airborne Expendable CTD Probes were dropped into open leads from the Twin to record an ocean section across the north end of Nares Strait.

Project The Collaborative O-Buoy Project: Deployment of a Network of Arctic Ocean Chemical Sensors for the IPY and beyond Metadata Principal Investigator: Donald Perovich Patricia Matrai Paul Shepson William Simpson Francisco Chavez Description: Collaborators from five institutions will work to build and deploy an Arctic Ocean network of rugged and autonomous buoys (named "O-Buoys"), capable of observing three key atmospheric chemical species, bromine monoxide-BrO, ozone-O3, and carbon dioxide-CO2 through 2016 (with each O-Buoy being operational for up to 2 years). O3 and CO2 are two of the most important greenhouse gases that have, as yet, poorly understood behavior in the Arctic. BrO is a reaction intermediate that is involved in the extraordinary ozone and mercury atmospheric depletion that occurs during polar springtime, both of which have strong consequences for human and ecosystem health in the Arctic region. These buoys are immersed through the sea ice into the ocean surface, thereby providing a constant temperature (-1.7 degrees C) environment for sensor stability. The original O-Buoy project funded by NSF included design and testing of the O-Buoy. In the current project, 11 new O-Buoys will be constructed and deployed along with the four already built. As a pilot project, two of the new O-Buoys will include seawater sensors for CO2, oxygen, pH, fluorescence, backscatter, temperature and salinity in addition to the atmospheric O3, BrO, and CO2 sensors. Throughout the project, data from each O-Buoy will be subject to QA/QC protocols by automated processing initially, with preliminary data available on a regular basis on the Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (ACADIS) site. All final data and metadata will be ultimately archived on ACADIS after final analysis at the end of each deployment. This network of O-Buoys, coordinated and clustered with other buoys in ice based observatories, will enable the scientific community to first observe and, next, better understand the impact of Arctic surface change on atmospheric composition and chemistry. Outreach to local K-8 schools will include an "Adopt-a-Buoy" program. Video footage from deployments/recoveries and interviews with colleagues and native Arctic people will be contributed to the ongoing http://www.arcticstories.net site, and activities and results will be communicated via the O-Buoy web site.

Dataset BEST: Bering Ecosystem Study   BEST 2008-2009 Bottom-Anchored Moorings Metadata Download Data Authoritative Source: data.eol.ucar.edu Author: Dr. Knut Aagaard Principal Investigator: Dr. Knut Aagaard Originator: Dr. Knut Aagaard Point of Contact: Roger Andersen DOI: doi:10.5065/D69Z92XQ Permanent Link , Citation Description: In a collaborative effort between University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) and University of Washington (UW), this dataset addresses the impact of physical variability on the processes and structure of the Bering shelf ecosystem, with special emphasis on how freshwater redistributed by the shelf circulation or introduced from sea ice modifies stratification and nutrient distributions. In particular, the effort seeks to understand how changes in sea ice affect advection and mixing; how variable fluxes of low-salinity, nutrient-deficient (but iron-rich) coastal waters affect production; how cross-shelf fluxes are established and altered; how these fluxes might respond to climate change; how the seasonal stratification cycle is controlled; and how the buoyant coastal flow evolves. The dataset is using moored instruments and shipboard hydrography (including extensive 18O sampling) to address this problem set. The first set of UAF-UW BEST moorings, nine in all, was deployed in July 2008 from the US Coast Guard Cutter Healy. The locations of the moorings are shown in Figure 1 as red squares, circles, and stars; the red triangles denote NOAA moorings. Depending on depth, the moorings carry various instrumentation. For example, at the outermost locations on each line (square, circle, and star), over the 55 m isobath, each mooring has an ice-avoiding modem-linked temperature / conductivity recorder at 10 m, another temperature / conductivity recorder with fluorometer at 22 m, below that a chain of 15 precision temperature recorders, and then an acoustic Doppler current profiler at 46 m and another temperature/conductivity recorder 2 m above the bottom. These moorings were recovered and replaced with similar ones in July 2009 from aboard the R/V Point Sur. The data reported here are from the first deployment, 2008-2009. Note: this is version 3 of the data, ADCP bottom track direction corrected and updated on November 20, 2014. Progress: Not Assigned - Dataset state not assigned.

Christensen Scott Pegau Principal Investigator: Scott Pegau John P. Christensen Originator: John P. Christensen Point of Contact: John P. Christensen Description: This project began an evaluation of nutrients and phytoplankton standing stocks in the central Arctic Ocean based on sampling at the North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO). The first sampling occurred in April 2005, the second in April 2006, where eight vertical profiles of hydrographic properties (salinity, temperature, sigma-t), in-situ fluorescence, and nutrients in the region of the NPEO were determined. Vertical profiles of hydrographic, fluorescence, and nutrients over the upper 150 m were obtained using a Sea-Bird SBE-19 CTD (serial number 1923347-2995) combined with a Wetstar model WS3S miniature flow-through fluorometer (serial number 646P), which had an excitation wavelength of 460 nm and an emission wavelength of 695 nm. The continuous CTD profiles were processed using standard SeaSoft software with the results being binned into 0.5 m depth intervals. The fluorometer was calibrated in the laboratory with aqueous solutions of resorufin (Christensen, 2006a). The fluorescence of resorufin was compared with the fluorescence of purified chlorophyll-a (from the algae Anacystis nidulans) dissolved in buffered acetone (10 ml of 1% (weight per volume) magnesium carbonate per L of 90% acetone). These chlorophyll solutions showed a fluorescence of 40.0 times that of resorufin for the same molar concentrations. The output of the fluorometer was first converted to fluorescence of resorufin (mmol/L) and then to that of chlorophyll-a (expressed in microgram-chl/L) using this factor and the molecular weight of chlorophyll-a (893.5 g/mole).

Raynolds Josefino Comiso Donald A. (Skip) Walker Principal Investigator: Donald A. (Skip) Walker Uma Bhatt Originator: Martha K. Raynolds Point of Contact: Martha K. Raynolds Description: This data set contains land surface temperatures in the circumpolar region of the Arctic derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data. The AVHRR data were compiled from 1982 to 2003, providing the longest satellite temperature record available. The length of this record, especially the inclusion of the earliest years, was important in producing a mean that characterized the conditions that created the present distribution of arctic vegetation. Arctic vegetation communities are only beginning to respond to recent climate changes, and our goal was to minimize this effect in the temperature data. The AVHRR temperature data provide better spatial resolution than modeled data sets, which interpolate between climate stations. And arctic climate stations are few, unevenly distributed around the pole, and located mostly along coasts. The finer spatial resolution and coarser temporal resolution of the AVHRR temperature data are more appropriate for analyzing vegetation distribution.

Raynolds Josefino Comiso Donald A. (Skip) Walker Principal Investigator: Donald A. (Skip) Walker Uma Bhatt Originator: Martha K. Raynolds Point of Contact: Martha K. Raynolds Description: This data set is of landscape age of the Arctic, in 1000 years since the land surface was available for vegetation colonization. It is in vector format. The age of most recent deglaciation, emergence from the sea, or drainage of proglacial lakes was obtained from a compilation of Quaternary glaciations, available in digital format (Ehlers and Gibbard, 2004). Supplemental data provided in some of the regional chapters were especially useful. Although landscape age estimates are bound to change as research continues, the compilation used in this study includes the best available current estimates, and provides a relatively robust data set for analysis at a circumpolar scale. All dates in this study are in calendar years. Dates for Canada were converted from 14C years to calendar years (Dyke, 2004). Data are in 1000 calendar years.

These data are utilized in the Arctic Rapid Integrated Monitoring System (ArcticRIMS) project to improve the development of the water stress model. This water stress model shows the effects of water resources, humans and climate change in the Arctic. Recent studies suggest that climate change will have a significant impact on Arctic hydrology. However, it is currently unknown which regions of the pan-Arctic are most vulnerable to future changes. In order to begin to address the future change to freshwater availability on a pan-Arctic scale, a system of Arctic typologies were used to enable the integration of biophysical data with socio-cultural data produced regionally, such as demographics and water values. Those mature data sets were used to study the strategic transformations of the high latitude water cycle. The overall objective of this research is to use a wide array of existing data sets in a synthesis effort to describe the vital role of freshwater in the lives of people in the pan-Arctic, how it has changed in the recent past, and how it is likely to change in the future.

Studies were based on a series of cruises conducted from 2008-2010 in spring, summer and fall. Biotic and abiotic data were synthesized from these cruises to provide a better understanding of the potential effects of hydrographic variations in rearing conditions and on transport, dispersal, and distribution of early life stages of these key marine fish species in the eastern Bering Sea.

A modified 2-point dilution method (Landry 1993, Strom et al. 2006, Strom and Fredrickson 2008) was used to estimate phytoplankton growth, MZ grazing and the fraction of phytoplankton daily production removed by MZ grazing. Chlorophyll was measured as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass. Water samples for the determination of MZ abundance, biomass and composition were collected in association with the dilution experiments and at additional selected stations and preserved with 10% (final concentration) acid Lugol's solution in amber glass bottles.

Title: Seabird Broad-Scale Distribution, 2008 (B64) Description: &lt;p&gt;This dataset examines seabird (and marine mammal) distribution relative to oceanographic and biological features of the Bering Sea. It examines the current influence of oceanographic and prey dynamics on the distribution and abundance of seabirds as top predators. By using multiple years of data to examine seabird response to these variables, it aims to predict how changes in the Bering Sea ecosystem will alter the distribution of apex predators.&lt;/p&gt; Metadata URL: https://www.aoncadis.org/dataset/id/15c2e443-638d-11e4-8886-00c0f03d5b7c.html

Title: Seabird Broad-Scale Distribution, 2010 (B64) Description: &lt;p&gt;The goal of this project was to describe the broad-scale distribution of seabirds in conjunction with the Bering Sea Integrated Ecosystem Research Program (BSIERP) funded by the North Pacific Research Board. As a component of BSIERP, observers were placed on selected vessels of opportunity in collaboration with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), projects funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). The primary focus was on the Bering Sea, but additional surveys were conducted in collaboration with vessel-based projects in the Arctic (funded by Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE)) and in the Gulf of Alaska. In 2010, there were 20 cruises in the Chukchi/Beaufort seas, Bering Sea, and Gulf of Alaska from March through October. In the Bering Sea, the observers surveyed 29,451 km of transects. In the Arctic and Gulf of Alaska the observers surveyed 3,014 and 4,964km, respectively. The observers used strip-transect methodology and followed USFWS protocol (see observer manual for details). All data have also been submitted to the North Pacific Pelagic Seabird Database (NPPSD).&lt;/p&gt; Metadata URL: https://www.aoncadis.org/dataset/id/1618cc76-638d-11e4-8886-00c0f03d5b7c.html

Bluhm Principal Investigator: Bodil A. Bluhm Point of Contact: Bodil A. Bluhm Timothy L. Whiteaker DOI: doi:10.5065/D67M05ZX Permanent Link , Citation Description: This data set is a compilation of close to 1000 epifaunal invertebrate sampling stations from over 20 research cruises to the northern Bering Sea (US side), Chukchi Sea (Russian and US sides) and Beaufort Sea (US side) from 1972 to 2012. The vast majority of stations were trawl hauls and a few were photographic sampling stations. Trawl hauls were conducted with a range of different nets including various otter trawls but mostly the 83-112 Eastern Otter trawl, and a plumb-staff beam trawl. Mesh sizes ranged from 4-38 mm in the cod end and 7-89 mm in the body of the net. Trawl duration ranged from 1-30 minutes and trawl speed ranged from 1.5-5 knots. Where available, variables compiled include cruise and station names, locations and water depth, haul and net information, contact information of data holder, as well as total abundance, biomass and taxon richness of epifaunal invertebrates. The latter is biased by varying levels of taxonomic resolution in the source data. Many fields are blank, either because the data have not yet been released as is the case for many recent cruises, or because hauls were not quantitative as is the case for some historic data sets. Data on fishes from the same hauls are not reported here. Column headers are explained in the readme file. Changes made to the original data sets provided by the project contacts or as found in data archives include, where possible: standardization of abundance to individuals per 1000 square meters; standardization of biomass to kilograms wet weight per 1000 square meters; and subtraction of obvious infaunal taxa, eggs and fragments from the taxon count.

Copass Principal Investigator: Catharine D. Copass Point of Contact: Catharine D. Copass Description: This dataset contains aboveground biomass data collected in the four Ivotuk sites at approximately peak season biomass, summer 1998. The biomass was harvested in 20X50 cm plots, with 10 to 12 replicates per site. The plant tissues were further separated into live and dead and new versus old growth of leaves and stems. When possible, the biomass was sorted to species level. In general, data has been organized at the plant functional type level. This dataset is available in both ASCII and EXCEL formats - For data browsing, we suggest ordering the EXCEL version and using EXCEL to plot the data.

Western Lake water hourly time series - Temperature, depth, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, water level (CALON) If you have published a scientific paper using ACADIS data, please consider filling out our ACADIS Publication Survey .

Dataset Collaborative Research: Toward a Circumarctic Lakes Observation Network (CALON)-- Multiscale observations of lacustrine systems   Western Lake water hourly time series - Temperature, depth, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, water level (CALON) Metadata Description: Water quality time series files for ~30 lakes on the North Slope of Alaska in the western transect of our project. Separate research teams work on two transects (Eastern and Western), and the lakes are subdivided by these regional groupings. This dataset contains lake code names, field notes, and subdirectories of the data separated by year collected. These include time series of water temperature and lake depth, and dissolved oxygen and conductivity for a select group of lakes ("focus lakes"). ReadMe files provide the instrumentation and logging details, and there are files that contain the location of each site. Details: These folders contain .csv files of lake water temperature time series collected during the period April to August. Data collected at the same locations using the same configuration will be found in the yearly files, where the year is defined as that year when the data were downloaded. At the first subfolder level, the lakes are differentiated by the Eastern and Western Transects; see accompanying jpg image (CALON_sites_overview.jpg) and list of Lake Float Locations. The instrumentation configuration is identical in most cases. Generally, a rope is attached to an anchor. The other end of the rope is attached to a float. An Onset computer U12-015 water temperature data logger is affixed to the rope 30 cm below the float. Another data logger (U20) is attached to the rope just above the anchor. The U20 is a water level/water temperature logger, so records the change in the water depth over the period of record. The water level is calibrated and corrected using the barometric pressure record from the nearest terrestrial met station. This is done in the Onset Hoboware software. All sensor specifications are shown below. In April, a 10 diameter hole is augured through the ice and the instrument string is lowered to the lake bottom. A pole is used to push the float down the hole and beneath the ice, where it remains until the ice cover melts in spring. Thus, the upper logger is measuring the temperature near the base of the ice slab, which moves toward the surface as the flow melts and thins. The loggers are retrieved in August, and a new instrument package is deployed. The floats are redeployed in the original location the following April. It should be noted that there is often some movement of the floats that get entrained by the moving ice slab in spring or by strong wave activity in summer. All loggers record hourly measurements on the hour using Alaska Daylight Time (ADT). In each data file, column headings are Date, Time, ADT, TempC(deployment depth of upper logger), TempC (deployment depth of lower logger), Water Level, m. In a few cases, additional sensor strings were deployed at a different location in the same lake. This typically occurred when the lake was especially deep (>4 m), and was designed to obtain measurements of the entire water column. In these cases, an Onset Computer U23 water temperature logger was used. These data are shown as additional columns in the .csv files. Finally, there are also some stand alone files for a few select lakes (focus lakes) that report time series of water quality including dissolved oxygen and conductivity. Loggers were manufactured by Onset Computer; Hobo U24-001 for conductivity and U26-001 for the dissolved oxygen (see specs below).

Session 1 and X - Data Management and Acquisition Mail questions to: todd.valentic@sri.com What are SOA's - service oriented architectures - computers talking to computers for accessing data from websites - i.e. catalog service - soa is an approach, web services are an implementation Need to educate community about technologies and techniques - Get to know CADIS team - Work with PI's for web services - they have the knowledge for QC, but not expertise on technical side - Need feedback mechanisms - reprocessing, how to transmit issues and errors back to source - Other critera for data collected about humans sensitivity issues authorization hipa? identity exposure via metadata alone Classes of data - 0 - raw, 1 - first pass, 2 - best quality (final) - "regridded" or output data for models, etc - data from outside - model output - how to treat? - AON-based model efforts - what type metadata (CF) - can they be treated just like data from the network? - exposing ancillary fields in model data - CADIS will support wide range of data types - more broad than just point observations - metadata closley works with other sources - Reanalysis of weather data - Authorization - who? - public domain? - PI defined groups? - AON requirement? - authenticating vs autherization - Need to track who is coming in and who is using data - What are the community policies? - can we track? - do we need to track? - Feedback is useful - PI and users protected for problems in data - machine to machine access impacts? - Socialization aspects - "embargoed" data - policy, rules of the road - responsibility to contact data PIs (ie before publication) to make sure data are correct, latest, etc - example - IPCC climate change model runs - embargos, authentication - barrier, moving from social agreement to technical impl. - problem is people want to hold on to data until it is ok Is AON SEARCH? - What is the take of the SEARCH data management group - talk this afternoon - They are intersecting circles - AON is a fundamental component of SEARCH - AON is concrete in producing data' - AON will influence SEARCH data management plan - What is the scope of the problem? - AON will collect data and use data from others - need to work with other data providers - need to know what you need and how to access it - do you want to send people to other places? risk of loosing them - Is AON providing a portal or VO? - Connecting to others means knowing about the issues necessary to integrate with them - GEOS - endoresments, but no funding - how much accomodation Priorities and directions - Need something soon - How to handle data now - What data exists and where to get it - good first step - then proceed to services - Centralized metadata? registry - metadata, location of datasets, inventory - Where is the metadata portal accessible? will others be able to find it? - Importance of taking care of data - NSF's investment - tension between caring and access? - how to make data useful to broader community and stakeholders? Metadata - level of service - more info provided, better/more things we can do THREDDS - approach to inventory - appears on portals, services - human and machine access - harvestable by GCMD - automatically search against other data sets Q7 - Data assimilation and fusion integration - Important for regulatity in space and time for effective modelling - Use of old climatologies - Where to get most up to date datasets - Push (RSS) vs pull (FTP) data sets - Event based observing Data Policies - - more liberal policies better? - IPY data policy - liberal with restrictions for IP, privacy issues - define data (projects in honeycomb) - SEARCH policy - builds off IPY - Does AON follow SEARCH policy? - for the moment yes - AON is integral with SEARCH - can evolve as necessary - Should be made as quickly as available - Delay in data access reduces usefulness (ie forecasting) - Credit for collecting data - first pub - public access enough? - make access equal to publications - Need for attitude changes - Formal citation for data - Use IPY as an opportunity to try new things! Assimilation models for sea ice thickness Access and archive legacy information - North slope - Who to contact - Difficulty in finding NSF legacy data/PIs

Ocean/Ice Breakout Group Ocean/Ice Breakout Group Wed, 28 March 2007 Coverage surprisingly good Identifying Gaps: Nares Strait Hudson Strait (is it in the domain?) Makarov Basin- Small band, difficult to access.

SCIEX sub-launched CTDs? Assess Bering Sea efforts (BEST and other) to determine of there is sufficient activity. Shelf-basin Exchange lines… need to include these in the accounting. Canadian efforts will likely cover some of this (Carmack & collaborators). Original SEARCH Imp discussions included reliance on Barrow observatory. Moorings across-slope? Need for real-time data access? Application of low-cost moorings? REMUS missions? Perhaps two motivations- large-scale, long time-scale variability, process studies to understand mechanisms driving cross-slope exchange. Should we be pushing a cabled component? Good leverage with other measurement efforts at Barrow might make this a reasonable investment. Importance of understanding cross-slope exchange as a general issue. Are the boundary arrays adequate? Should a project directly address the question of how/where heat release from inflowing Atlantic waters occur. Impact of Bering Sea inflow on local communities. Need for accompanying atmospheric observations. Big request, not easy to fulfill. Balance between depth (many parameters, complex observations) and breadth (many locations, cheap and reliable). Sediment traps Have local communities inventory plant and animal species. Document what is coming up in hunting/nets. What simple things can be included. Perhaps these efforts are ‘operational’, not meant to compete with regular science proposals, but need to be reviewed with different criteria. Also worries about how entire effort transitions to long-term observing effort. Weakness of existing biological components- not complete bio-efforts, but instead augment existing programs with what can be done now. Desire to have repeat occupations of same sections, rather than constant shifting of sampling region. How does BEST fit into AON- does it count as part of the network? How do we integrate, and does this address stakeholder needs in ways that the larger AON elements do not? Human impacts notes the disconnect between ocean focus on gateways, large-scale issues and the community desires to understand local circulation as an aid to transportation and hunting. Other Bering Sea- Tom W. points out a couple of smaller programs that include community participation. How to coordinate AON and BEST efforts?

Project Collaborative Research: Unraveling the post-Pliocene Arctic Ocean transition to the icehouse climate Metadata Principal Investigator: Leonid Polyak Brian Haley Description: Funds are provided to allow the PIs to develop a continuous record of changes in the Arctic Ocean in response to climatic cooling and growth of ice sheets in the Early to Middle Pleistocene based on sediment cores from the western Arctic Ocean. They will utilize a suite of proxies (microfaunal assemblages, stable and radiogenic isotopes, biomarkers, sediment mineralogy and elemental composition and grain size) to reconstruct variations in glacial inputs, sea ice, and water circulation. The use of paleobiological and geochemical proxies will be greatly enhanced by a unique sediment core that has a rich calcareous microfossil record extending through most of the Quaternary and potentially into the Pliocene, unlike other cores from the Arctic Ocean. This is a unique find that they can capitalize on as Arctic cores typically preserve calcareous microfossils only in Late Quaternary sediments. Age control will be achieved by paleomagnetic, 10Be, Sr-isotope, and cyclostratigraphic methods. This research will allow them to test whether there was an overall progressive growth in ice sheets and sea-ice cover and if sea ice and continental glaciers changed synchronously. They will also test whether the Mid Pleistocene Transition led to the growth of a super-thick Laurentide Ice Sheet by analyzing changes in glacial inputs from the northern Laurentide margin, with a multi-century scale record for the threshold glaciation ca. 650 ka, which initiated the icehouse world.

Project Development of data products for the University of Wisconsin High Spectral Resolution Lidar Metadata Principal Investigator: Edwin Eloranta Description: This project will maintain the University of Wisconsin Arctic High Spectral Resolution Lidar (AHSRL) at Eureka on Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic. Instruments were initially deployed at Eureka in August of 2005 in efforts to extend the knowledge of Arctic cloudiness with additional long-term observation sites as part of the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH). The NOAA cloud radar and the AHSRL are part of this instrument suite. Both instruments are returning continuous high quality data. In combination, they provide unique information on the optical and micro-physical characteristics of clouds. The AHSRL operates as an Internet appliance which is remotely controlled from the University of Wisconsin's laboratory. It is completely eye safe. As a result, the AHSRL is able to gather well-calibrated data sets at much lower cost than possible with conventional lidars. Data is transmitted via the Internet and is made available to researchers around the world in real time via a publicly accessible web site.

Project EAGER: Developing a high-resolution late Holocene sediment record of rapid Arctic climate change from the Colville delta and adjacent Beaufort Sea inner shelf Metadata Principal Investigator: Mead Allison Description: The PIs propose to develop a new, high-resolution (annual to sub-decadal) paleoclimate record (0-1,000 y) from sediment cores taken on the Arctic inner continental shelf. The proposal is a follow-up to a regular Arctic Natural Sciences panel submission that was criticized during review due to 1) absence of adequate data to substantiate a high-quality paleoclimate record in this setting, and 2) questions about the logistical success in light of the absence of UNOLS vessels to work in the high Arctic. Neither issue can be addressed without a proof of concept study such as proposed here. The PIs will collect sediment cores from the inner shelf on one cruise of the R/V Annika Marie, a local and privately chartered research vessel, presently scheduled for late September 2009 (ice free period) adjacent to the Colville delta on the Beaufort Sea coast of Alaska. Ancillary seismic transect data (sub-bottom CHIRP and side-scan sonar) will be collected prior to coring to locate the best preserved record of depositionally laminated sediments of this time interval. About 5 to 15 sites will be occupied on the shelf and adjacent Simpson Lagoon. All cores will be diver-collected in less than 8 m water depth: short push cores will be used to retrieve the high-porosity recent sediment layers, and longer cores (up to 5 m) will be collected with a submersible portable vibracorer. All cores will be analyzed for stratigraphy (x-radiography), bulk organic and mineral content, and geochronology of the last 100 to 200 y (using 210Pb and 137Cs radiotracers). Two cores will be selected from these for detailed analysis of paleoclimate proxies: the age-depth relationship for the deeper part of these cores will be determined using AMS radiocarbon dating of benthic foraminifera (5/core). Climate indicators that will be applied are organic biomarkers (ligninphenols, plant pigments, and ä13C) and mineral tracers (clay mineralogy, heavy mineral assemblages, granulometry, event layer stratigraphy). The central hypothesis is that the Colville inner shelf contains a high quality sediment record, that, if exploited, will dramatically improve knowledge of high Arctic paleoclimate over the last centuries to a millennia. They believe this deltaic region has sufficiently high linear sediment accumulation rates (>1 cm/y) to preserve a seasonal and interannual record of climate change-induced mineral and particulate organic carbon (POC) flux variations to the seafloor from three distinct sources. These are 1) rivers that drain the Brooks Range and the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP), 2) coastal erosion of ACP permafrost deposits and 3) marine primary production by phytoplankton, ice algae, and benthos. After an initial micro-scale examination of recent event layer (annual and storm deposits) mineral and POC succession, necessary to interpret paleoclimate-induced fluctuations in composition, they propose to examine the downcore record of temporal variations in layers, comparing the two selected sites to decouple spatial changes in sources. Since the three end-member sources have distinct mineral/POC composition, temporal variations will provide proxy information about climate changes that influence their flux magnitude including 1) landfast ice extent, 2) river sediment supply from glacial (meltwater) and coastal plain (permafrost thawing) input, 3) summer-fall storminess and 4) primary productivity of the coastal zone.

Project How does changing seasonality affect the capacity of arctic stream networks to influence nutrient fluxes from the landscape to the ocean Metadata Principal Investigator: William Bowden CO Principal Investigator: Wilfred Wollheim Michael Gooseff Description: Stream networks are intimately connected to the landscapes through which they flow and significantly transform nutrients and organic matter that are in transport from landscapes to oceans. This work will quantify the relative influences of throughflow, lateral inputs, and hyporheic (a layer of surface sediments that contains water which exchanges continuously with water in the open channel) regeneration on the seasonal fluxes of C, N, and P in an arctic river network, and determine how these influences will shift under seasonal conditions that are likely to be substantially different in the future. This objective is a logical extension of earlier. This work will focus on seasonal dynamics at different river reach scales (1st to 4th order streams) and will lay the groundwork for a whole river network model to integrate the influences of throughflow, lateral inputs, hyporheic regeneration, and in-stream metabolism on C, N, and P fluxes through an entire river network.

Project Ice Mass Balance Buoy Network: Coordination with DAMOCLES Metadata Principal Investigator: Jacqueline Richter-Menge Description: Researchers supported by this grant will deploy an array of autonomous ice mass balance buoys designed to ascertain thermodynamic changes in the mass balance of arctic sea ice. Specifically, the ice mass balance (IMB) buoys will be incorporated in the Developing Arctic Modelling and Observing Capabilities for Long-term Environmental Studies (DAMOCLES) atmosphere-ice-ocean observing array, the large European Union IPY effort to characterize arctic climate change and its likely impacts. The sea-ice component of the DAMOCLES sea-ice array includes a variety of instruments that examine ice thickness at varying temporal and spatial scales. The IMB adds the capability to define how and why the thickness of the arctic sea-ice cover changes. The IMB buoy can determine what portion of the thickness changes are due to differences in snow depth, ice growth, surface melt, and bottom melt. The effort in the second and third years will consist of analyzing, disseminating, and archiving the data from the IMBs, so it can be used widely to improve the understanding of changes in the Arctic sea ice cover. This work will contribute to the ongoing ice mass balance (IMB) buoy deployments currently sponsored by NOAA, as a contribution to Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH), and coordinated with the International Arctic Buoy Programme (IABP) and the North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO). Further, it directly addresses major Arctic science questions, identified in the recent Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) report, the report from the SEARCH Implementation Workshop, and endorsed International Polar Year (IPY) projects. Active involvement in DAMOCLES will be another step toward realizing a close coordination of IPY activities between DAMOCLES and the US SEARCH program and, more broadly, lays the groundwork for the establishment of an International Arctic Ocean Observing System.

Project IPY: Microbial winter survival physiology: a driver on microbial community composition and carbon cycling Metadata Principal Investigator: Joshua Schimel Jessica Ernakovich Matthew Wallenstein Description: Arctic landscapes are changing rapidly. The "greening" and "shrubification" of the Arctic drive climate feedbacks (via albedo and energy exchange) as well as affecting human activities directly. Vegetation change, however, is driven belowground by nutrient availability, a result of microbial feedbacks that also have independent effects on the climate system (e.g. CO2 and CH4 emissions). The microbial system, therefore, plays a key role in regulating the functioning of the overall Arctic System. As organisms migrate and spread across the Arctic, the processes they regulate migrate with them. Predicting changes in the pattern of tundra biogeochemistry therefore requires understanding the factors that regulate the distribution and functioning of key groups of microbes. Are bacteria and fungi regulated simply by the chemical substrates available to them, and thus by plant distribution? Or alternatively, are microbes independently regulated by the challenges of tolerating the freezing conditions of winter? What are microbial adaptations to low temperature, and what are their ecological consequences? These are interesting questions for basic microbial ecology, but are also important in the context of the changing Arctic. The core hypotheses of this project are: 1) the distribution of specific microbial groups is controlled primarily by plant community composition, but 2) the challenge of acclimating to winter requires changes in membrane composition, cryoprotectants, and freeze-tolerance proteins that involve physiological costs to microbes that have important implications for overall ecosystem function. Hypotheses will be tested by analyzing patterns of microbial distribution and physiology across toposequences in Alaska (low Arctic) and Greenland (high Arctic), capturing latitude and plant community variation. Seasonal changes (pre- and post-freeze, pre- and post-thaw) will be assessed by using clone library and quantitative genetic analyses (QPCR) to evaluate microbial community composition. Microbial membrane chemistry (phospholipids) and cryoprotectants (amino acids, trehalose, polyols) will be assessed by chemical analyses. Shifts in protein production patterns, including anti-freeze proteins, chaperones, and others will be assessed using proteomic techniques. This work will be supported by laboratory studies evaluating specific aspects of freezing stress: rate, temperature, and duration. It will be integrated with other studies on pan-Arctic microbial population dynamics by collaboration with the ICSU MERGE network. This will be the first ever study on how stress physiology regulates microbial distributions.

Bowden CO Principal Investigator: Michael Gooseff Benjamin Crosby Jeremy Jones Edward Schuur Rudiger Gens George Kling Mark Jorgenson Gary Kofinas Edward Rastetter Elena Sparrow Joshua Schimel Michelle Mack Torre Jorgenson Toni Lewkowicz Samantha Miller Allison Woodward Description: Recent summaries of international research clearly document the past and future extent of climate warming in the Arctic. These summaries suggest that in the future, rising temperatures will be accompanied by increased precipitation, mostly as rain: 20% more over the Arctic as a whole and up to 30% more in coastal areas during the winter and autumn. These climate changes will have important impacts on Arctic Systems. Of direct interest to this research is the likelihood that warming will promote permafrost degradation and thaw. Formerly frozen soils may be further destabilized by increased precipitation, leading to hillslope thermokarst failures. Recent work has documented that thermokarst failures are abundant and appear to have become more numerous around Toolik Lake on the eastern North Slope and in the western Noatak River basin in Alaska. A widespread and long-term increase in the incidence of thermokarst failures may have important impacts on the structure and function of arctic headwater landscapes. This research will use a systems approach to address hypotheses about how thermokarst failures influence the structure and function of the arctic landscape. It will focus on the composition of vegetation, the distribution and processing of soil nutrients, and exports of sediments and nutrients to stream and lake ecosystems. Results obtained at this hillslope scale will be linked to patterns observed at the landscape scale to test hypotheses about the spatial distribution of thermokarst failures in the arctic foothills. It is important to understand these interactions because perhaps the greatest potential impacts of changing land surface processes and formation of thermokarst failures are feedbacks to the climate system through energy, albedo, water, and trace gas exchange. This research is designed to quantify linkages among climatology, hillslope hydrology, geomorphology, geocryology, community ecology of vegetation, soil nutrient dynamics, microbial ecology, trace gas dynamics, and aquatic ecology. It will employ a combination of field experimentation, remote sensing, and simulation modeling as a means to quantify these relationships. Project Group: ARCSS Period of Performance: Sep 1, 2008 - Aug 31, 2014 Northernmost Latitude: 90 degrees Southernmost Latitude: 45 degrees Westernmost Longitude: -180 degrees Easternmost Longitude: 180 degrees Award Numbers: 0806394 0806465 0806271 0806399 0806341 0806329 0806254 0806451 Datasets Water-level and subsurface water temperature at sensor from the Toolik River Thermokarst, 2010-2013 Dataset Data were collected to investigate if formation of gully thermokarst (TK) results in lowering of the water table and more rapid evacuation of water from above the frost table. Data were collected from 24 shallow screened wells. 2 replicate rows of 4 wells were located at: (a) a hillslope (HS) ~120m away from the gully TK, (b) perpendicular to the gully TK (TK) and (c) perpendicular to an unimpacted water track (WT) upstream of the gully TK. Note that water levels are the distance below the... Inventory and description of thermokarst features observed along the Umiat Corridor. Dataset Using a combination of aerial imagery and ~1m resolution airborne lidar (collected July, 2009), we use manual visual inspection of the two datasets to identify point locations of over 7000 thermal erosion features (thermokarst) of varying maturity. For each feature we report its x,y position, the facing direction of the feature, the local topographic setting, the geologic unit it occurs on, the relative age of the feature and the specific type of thermal erosion feature Ground temperature at and near thermokarst sites around Toolik Lake Field Station, Summer 2009-Summer 2012 Dataset Ground temperatures were measured hourly at ~20-50cm intervals below the ground surface inside and adjacent to thermokarst features in the region around Toolik Field Station. Ground temperatures were measured using Hobo thermistors. Temperatures at 0 and 20cm depths were measured directly in the ground whereas 40cm and deeper measurements were logged from dry wells installed in summer 2009. Several sites were at I minus 2 "IM2", around lake NE14, and Toolik River thermokarst (TRTK). Surface soil characteristics for six thermokarst chronosequences near Toolik Field Station and Noatak National Preserve, Alaska Dataset Surface organic and mineral soil layers were sampled in retrogressive thaw slump disturbance scars and nearby undisturbed tundra to estmate the influence of this thermo-erosional--thermokarst--disturbance type on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools. Within six independent sites, we identified multiple thaw slump scars and determined time after disturbance for each scar by (1) aging the population of tall deciduous shrubs rooted in the mineral soil and (2) by dating the basal layer of the...

Stream Ecology of Thermokarsts and Impacted Waters in Alaska's Noatak and North Slope Dataset Biogeochemistry, Benthic Chemistry, and Whole Stream Metabolism of thermokarst impacted waters on Alaska's North Slope and Noatak region. Multiple Element Limitation Thermal Erosion Features Dataset [Metadata only] We calibrated the Multiple Element Limitation (MEL IVarc, Rastetter et al., 2013 and Pearce et al., in press) model to Alaskan arctic tundra to simulate recovery of thermal erosion features (TEFs) caused by permafrost thaw and mass wasting. The MEL model was calibrated to match annual C, N, P and water fluxes of tussock tundra on the North Slope of Alaska near Toolik Lake, AK (68° 38'N, 149° 43'W) (see Pearce, in press for details). The calibrated simulates acidic tussock tundra under 2000... Ecosystem nutrient cycling following thermokarst disturbance Dataset Our purpose was to characterize nutrient cycling recovery patterns after thermokarst disturbance and to assess how well these patterns fit ecological paradigms of nutrient cycling after disturbance. To do this, we measured carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus pools and cycling rates in the surface organic and mineral soils of three retrogressive thaw slumps in Northern Alaska. In addition, we measured legume nodule biomass and spring thaw nutrient inputs. At each slump we established recovery... The impact of spring thaw litter leachate on soil biogeochemistry Dataset Winter vegetation decomposition promotes leachate release at spring thaw, which represents an important substrate for aquatic microbes and aquatic biogeochemical cycling. However, it is unknown how this leachate impacts microbial processes at the terrestrial source. In this study we investigated the impact of litter leachate on microbial process rates and soil biogeochemical pools in several tundra ecosystems during spring thaw. We collected frozen winter soil cores and vegetation from three... Soil respiration, water chemistry, and soil gas data for thermokarst features and undisturbed tundra on the North Slope of Alaska Dataset This dataset contains soil respiration, water chemistry, and soil gas data for thermokarst and reference tundra sites on the North Slope of Alaska. Data were collected around the Toolik Field Station (68.63°N, 149.60°W) in May-August of 2009-2012. Additional samples were collected from Feniak Lake (68.27°N, 158.34°W) in and Kelly River (67.94°N, 162.39°W). To test the impact of thermokarst on the hydrologic export of carbon and nitrogen, we measured carbon (DOC, DIC, and dissolved CH4),...

Estimates of C and N loss from moist acidic tundra sites burned in the 2007 Anaktuvuk River Fire. Dataset [Metadata only] Estimated mean pre-fire C and N pools, and C and N loss from 20 sites in the Anaktuvuk River Fire (2007). These sites were sampled in summer of 2008. In each site, we characterized residual organic soils and used biometric relationships developed in unburned sites to reconstruct pre-fire soil organic layer depth, and plant and soil C and N pools. We then estimated fire-driven losses of C and N from plant and soil organic layer pools. Burned soil surface radiocarbon values for moss macrofossils plucked from the Anaktuvuk River Fire sites Dataset [Metadata only] We used radiocarbon dating of the organic soil surface remaining post-fire to examine whether the fire burned into ancient and likely irreplaceable soil C pools. Suprisingly, it did not; all radiocarbon dates from burned soil surfaces contained bomb carbon, setting the maximum age of the burned soil surfaces at ~50 years.

Project Ultraviolet Radiation in the Arctic Metadata Principal Investigator: Germar Bernhard John Frederick Author(s): Germar Bernhard, bernhard@biospherical.com (NSF Awards # 0856268 and # 1203250) John Frederick, frederic@uchicago.edu (NSF Awards # 0856268 and # 1203250) Description: In 1987, responding to serious ozone depletion reported in Antarctica, the National Science Foundation established a network of instruments to observe solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation at high latitudes. The network eventually grew to seven sites including two Arctic locations at Barrow, Alaska (71° 19 N), and Summit, Greenland (72° 34 N). Data available through ACADIS include measurements of UV radiation and related data products from Barrow starting in 1991 and from Summit starting in 2004. Effective 1-August 2009, the two sites were integrated into NSFs Arctic Observing Network as part of the NSF AON projects Ultraviolet Radiation in the Arctic and, since 2012, Ultraviolet Radiation in the Arctic: 2012-2015. Data include spectra of solar spectral irradiance between 280 and 600 nm, biologically effective dose-rates, total ozone, surface albedo, and cloud optical depth. The long time-series provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of a changing environment on UV radiation. Measurements at Summit are ideally suited to probe the free troposphere and study the effects of long-range transport of pollutants and aerosols on UV radiation. Data can also be used for validation of satellite observations, verification of models describing the transfer of radiation through the atmosphere, advancement of climate models, and addressing the SEARCH question whether the Arctic is moving to a new state.
